Cesare Rocchi argues that the Heartbleed problem isn’t C — <a href="http://www.upbeat.it/2014/04/15/its-not-c/">it’s the API</a>.

My counter-argument: people make mistakes. People make dumb APIs. With C, combine a dumb API and a mistake and you get Heartbleed.

That’s far less likely with another language.

Here’s the thing: we will always have dumb ideas and mistakes. We can and should do our best to eliminate them, but we’ll never succeed entirely. Because we know that, we’re negligent if we don’t do our best to minimize their consequences.
