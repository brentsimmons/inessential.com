>Methodological fundamentalists descend on technology from time to time. Hell, TDD and agile *started* as a rebellion against an older tech fundamentalism. As a profession, we’re suckers for The Word and want to know The True Way. Sometimes, the methodologies do help: structured programming, literate programming, strong types, weak types, objects, patterns, functional, agile: it’s all been good for us.

>But, perversely, these helpful little ideas often become modes of punishment.
