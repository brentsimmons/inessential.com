>When starting a new design project, the hardest part is finding the project’s voice. There are no easy solutions, and more than one <em>right</em> solution. You discover the voice through a repeating cycle of experimentation and refinement, one following the other, over and over. You try lots of things that turn out to be dead ends. With time and effort you accumulate enough familiarity with your project until one of the possible paths seems obvious.
