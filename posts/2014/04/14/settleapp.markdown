I helped Ondřej with some of the wording on the home page for [SettleApp](http://www.settleapp.co/).

Some advice for developers in general, off the top of my head:

* Use words that humans use. (No “algorithms.”)

* Use verbs. Verbs are vivid. Verbs trigger people’s imaginations — they picture themselves using the app.

* Use curly quotes.

* [Don’t use comma splices](http://inessential.com/2013/08/14/commas_for_developers).

* Don’t talk about how you rewrote any part of your app. Nobody cares.

* Don’t talk about how it’s native or about how it’s ready for the latest version of the OS. These things are assumed.

* Don’t be repetitive.

* Simplify.

* Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.

* Cut.
