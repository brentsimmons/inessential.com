Dan Gillmor, <a href="http://dangillmor.com/2014/04/25/indie-web-important/">Why the Indie Web movement is so important</a>:

>We’re in danger of losing what’s made the Internet the most important medium in history – a decentralized platform where the people at the edges of the networks – that would be you and me – don’t need permission to communicate, create and innovate.

I should probably pay attention to the Indie Web movement.
