We saved [Mike Lee’s episode](http://therecord.co/2014/04/25/mike_lee) for the end — it’s the closing episode of season 1. And it’s super-good.

When Apple’s new [Powerful](https://www.apple.com/iphone-5s/powerful/) ad came out, I was already thinking of Mike because we were working on this episode. But the “You’re more powerful than you think” message is perfect for Mike: he’s learned that lesson so well and now he teaches it.

The choice of the song “Gigantic” also fits Mike. Not because he’s a big guy, but because of his big, big love for making software and for the people in the community.

So: this is end of season 1. Chris and I are both immensely pleased with the podcast and the reaction to it. Thanks go to our sponsors — and especially to all our listeners. Making the show is a pleasure.

The Record will return.
