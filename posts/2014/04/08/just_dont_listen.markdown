In 1997 I went to <a href="http://inessential.com/2009/03/19/internetworld_spring_1997">InternetWorld</a> in Los Angeles — it may have been my first tech conference.

The prevailing wisdom was that in a few years the web would be consolidated. There’d be seven or eight large sites like PathFinder, and that’s it. Everybody knew it.

And then blogging happened.

Fast-forward to just ten years ago. In 2004 everybody knew that to write native apps was to stick to a hokey religion and ancient frameworks. No match for web apps. Time was <em>up</em> for native apps. <em>Everybody</em> knew it.

And then iPhone and iPad happened.

Now, today, there’s a report about how the web is doomed and [native apps are eating up everything](http://gigaom.com/2014/04/08/the-rise-of-mobile-apps-and-the-decline-of-the-open-web-a-threat-or-an-over-reaction/). <em>Everybody</em> knows it’s pretty much over for the web.

Do not believe it.
