It was back in my UserLand days, back in the ’90s, but I’ll be damned if I can remember the exact context.

I might have been working on some code — trying to take two similar things and create one generic solution for both.

Or it might have been some UI work (more likely) where I was trying to do something similar: make two similar things appear to the user as the same kind of thing.

This is what developers do, right? Collapse the differences, find the essence.

But [Dave](http://scripting.com/) saw that I was struggling and had some advice for me.

The issue was clarity, he said, which is not helped by making different things the same. In fact, things that are <em>truly</em> different should be treated as different, and the differences themselves should be made clear. If you’re struggling, it’s a good sign that the things are truly different.
