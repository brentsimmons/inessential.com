Nat Irons — formerly of Apple and The Stranger, now QA Manager at Black Pixel — will talk about Continuous Integration at <a href="http://seattlexcoders.org/2014/04/05/april-10---continuous-integration.html">this Thursday’s Xcoders</a>. The topic is high on my personal need-to-learn list.

Afterwards we’ll go to the Cyclops in Belltown for food and drinks.
