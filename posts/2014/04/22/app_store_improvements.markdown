David Smith has good ideas <a href="http://david-smith.org/blog/2014/04/16/towards-a-better-app-store/">Towards a Better App Store</a>.

I’m worried about a possible future where the only way to make money (outside of the super-rare mega-hit) is with 1) websites with recurring revenue and 2) Mac apps sold outside the Mac App Store.

The iOS app, in this future, would be a checklist item. Something you have to make but that doesn’t directly make money.

The problem with that future is that making a good iOS app is expensive and takes time. If quality can’t be justified with revenue, then quality will suffer.

(There are some people who’d argue that this future is already here.)

A better App Store would mean (by definition) that quality apps do better. And the future I worry about could be avoided.
