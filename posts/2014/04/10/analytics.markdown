A number of things contributed to that. Partly it was just time — we were busy developing the features of the app.

But another is that analytics (and data, and statistics) is a blind spot for me. Part of that comes from an intense respect for privacy, and part comes from preferring words and stories to numbers.

I’m learning. But I start from the belief that to use analytics at all is to lose your soul — which is immature, emotional, and incorrect.

It *is* possible — I keep telling myself — to use analytics to make better software (and blogs and podcasts) and stay on the good side, far away from the creepy line.
