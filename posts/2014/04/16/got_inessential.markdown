I went through Twitter’s impersonation process and was able to get the <a href="https://twitter.com/inessential">@inessential</a> username.

The way it worked is that Twitter renamed @inessential\_com, which I created a few days ago, to @inessential.

So if you followed @inessential_com, you’re now following @inessential, and there’s nothing you need to do.
