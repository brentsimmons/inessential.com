Graham Lee: <a href="http://blog.bignerdranch.com/4745-dependency-injection-ios/">Dependency Injection, iOS and You</a>:

>The reason brittle object graphs are bad is that you cannot easily replace parts of the application. If an object expects to ask its environment for a load of other objects around it, then you cannot simply tell it that it should be using another object. Dependency injection fixes that. It tells the object, “Hey, these are the objects you should work with,” so that if we want to change the collaborators we just inject different things.
