An NBC executive says that <a href="http://recode.net/2014/04/28/nbc-pokes-a-hole-in-twitters-tv-story/">Twitter isn’t bringing higher ratings</a> to its TV shows.

I hope this experiment ends. I can’t stand when TV news shows show Twitter messages. I can’t ignore them, because they’re <em>words</em> that appear on <em>screen</em>, and I have absolutely no defense against that.

They’ve never done anything but annoy me — they don’t contribute in any way.

Also: if Twitter *does* deliver higher ratings, then every TV show will figure out how to use Twitter. Can they all have higher ratings? Maybe if we all watch more television.
