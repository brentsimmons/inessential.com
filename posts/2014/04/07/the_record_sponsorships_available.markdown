We have two spots for season 1 of The Record still available — this Friday (April 11) and April 25.

April 25 is the closing episode of season 1, and is an especially strong episode.

If you’re interested in either or both, <a href="mailto:brent@ranchero.com?subject=Sponsorship">let me know</a>.

The Record averages over 10,000 downloads per episode. Its audience is developers and power users, mostly Mac and iOS. Price is $1,000 for one episode or $1,600 for both.
