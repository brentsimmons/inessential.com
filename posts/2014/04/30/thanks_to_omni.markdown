Eight of nine episodes of season one of [The Record](http://therecord.co/) were recorded in a three-day span at [The Omni Group](http://www.omnigroup.com/) offices last May.

They didn’t ask for any thanks or anything — they’re just plain generous. They even fed us. (Good food, too!)

Their generosity extends to the local Xcoders group. For months now the monthly meeting has been held in the Omni auditorium.

I’m a big fan of their apps, and I bet you are too. And I’m a big fan of the example they set as developers: create super-high-quality apps and charge a sustainable price.

Dear Omni: thank you.
