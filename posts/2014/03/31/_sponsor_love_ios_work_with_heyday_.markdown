Heyday gives people the superpower of perfect memory, with a beautiful lifelog that automatically records the places you go, things you see, and people you meet. Apple liked us so much they selected us for Editor’s Choice.

Heyday’s small team of 9 based in South Park San Francisco, includes Zac West, who was the lead developer of Adium for over 3 years. Great technical ability is a given, but since Heyday relies on engineers to own product decisions, product and design sense is highly valued. Visit [http://hey.co](http://hey.co) or send an email to <a href="mailto:siqi@hey.co">siqi@hey.co</a> and you’ll hear back in a few hours.
