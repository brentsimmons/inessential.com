I’ve started running a weekly sponsorship on my blog (a post every Monday) — I’m following the model of [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/), [Marco.org](http://www.marco.org/), [Shawn Blanc](http://shawnblanc.net/), and others.

I’m also running one display ad, an ad via [The Deck](http://decknetwork.net/). I’ve worked with The Deck before and I’m a fan. (The free version of NetNewsWire 3 ran ads from The Deck.)

Recently I realized that I have three projects: Vesper, The Record, and this blog. To take this blog as seriously as I take the other projects means, among other things, justifying the time I spend on it.

In case you’re interested, here’s more [information about sponsoring inessential.com](http://inessential.com/sponsors).
