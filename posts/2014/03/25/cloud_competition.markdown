Mary Jo Foley [reported yesterday](http://inessential.com/2014/03/24/rename) that Windows Azure will be renamed as Microsoft Azure.

Google Cloud just [dropped prices dramatically](http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2014/03/google-cloud-platform-live-blending-iaas-and-paas-moores-law-for-the-cloud.html). (Via [@justin](https://twitter.com/justin/status/448548760092549120).)

>We think cloud pricing should track Moore’s Law, so we’re simplifying and reducing prices for our various on-demand, pay-as-you-go services by 30-85%.

The [Amazon Web Services summit](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-summit-2014/san-francisco/) is Wednesday in San Francisco. It’s reasonable to expect some announcements then.

Microsoft’s [Build conference](http://www.buildwindows.com/) (also in San Francisco) is April 2-4. Might be more announcements then, too.

In general I expect cloud providers to keep lowering prices and adding features. There are a bunch of smaller providers too. You can get an SSD server from [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) for $5/month. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) has free tiers. Etc.

I keep saying to Cocoa developers: if your app needs web services (including syncing), and you’ve been reluctant to learn this stuff and to pay for web services, it’s a good time to get over your reluctance and get to work.
