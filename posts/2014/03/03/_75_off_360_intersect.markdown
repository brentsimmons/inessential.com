The [360|intersect conference](http://www.360intersect.com/) is April 28-29 in Seattle. It’s by the same folks who do 360|iDev — but this conference is at the intersection of technology and liberal arts.

It’s about “awesome technologists talking about the things they do away from their keyboards that makes the things they do at their keyboards even more incredible.”

To get $75 off, use the discount code `XCoders`. And I’ll see you there. (I’m not speaking, but I’m attending.)
