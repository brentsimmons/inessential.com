<a href="http://cocoamine.net/blog/2014/03/08/correlating-app-purchases-and-os-upgrades/">Charles Parnot</a> looks at David Smith’s data and concludes that yes, people who don’t upgrade their OS are the kind of people who don’t buy apps.

Even were this not true, I maintain that it’s too much work to support older versions of the OS for a pool of people that shrinks every day. It’s better to spend time on <em>awesomeness</em> over <em>compatibility</em>.
