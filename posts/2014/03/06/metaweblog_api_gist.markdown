Implementing the MetaWeblog API shouldn’t be difficult — but I’ve heard from some people that it can be.

I mentioned that I write for my static blog using MarsEdit, via a MetaWeblog API implementation. (That runs only on my local machine, via WEBrick.)

I just dug up the script. It’s insane Ruby, clearly written by a newbie — but it has also worked with zero issues for five years.

It’s also not something you can copy-and-paste, since it works only with my personal system.

But if it’s enough to help anyone else do a MetaWeblog API implementation, then cool. (It’s really not difficult.)

[Here’s metaweblog.rb as a gist](https://gist.github.com/brentsimmons/9398899).
