My old co-worker Nick Bradbury, who now works on WordPress for Android, writes <a href="http://nickbradbury.com/2014/03/28/androids-overblown-fragmentation-problem-revisited/">Android’s Overblown Fragmentation Problem Revisited</a>:

That’s an interesting point — different devices is one thing and different versions of the OS is another thing. If I had the ability to pick just one of the two problems, I’d pick different devices over different OSes. (Nick’s piece includes a breakdown of OS versions that their customers are running.)
