Whenever Twitter’s down (as it is at this writing), I get annoyed, then think of Anil Dash’s article on [The Web We Lost](http://dashes.com/anil/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html).

>The technology industry, like all industries, follows cycles, and the pendulum is swinging back to the broad, empowering philosophies that underpinned the early social web. But we’re going to face a big challenge with re-educating a billion people about what the web *means*, akin to the years we spent as everyone moved off of AOL a decade ago, teaching them that there was so much more to the experience of the Internet than what they know.

Twitter may be down, but blogs (and RSS) are up. While an individual blog may go down, blogs in general are *always* up.
