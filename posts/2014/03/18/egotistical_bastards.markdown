People sometimes ask me what it’s like to work with Dave and John. Answer: it’s *great*.

I have a theory: people who have a track record of doing good work may be egotistical bastards — me, for instance — but their egos are served by the shipping product and *not* by being right about the decisions along the way.

People who insist on “winning” the process will create products that are less good.

The shipping product is *everything*. Everything else is nothing.
