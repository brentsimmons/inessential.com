Simon Harris, [Functional programming in object oriented languages](http://www.harukizaemon.com/blog/2010/03/01/functional-programming-in-object-oriented-languages/):

>I’ve starting to think of constructor arguments as the mechanism for partially applying all the methods on an object. Considering an object as a partial application of a set of methods is really quite interesting to me. It almost dictates that methods MUST operate, in some way, on the state of the object — just as we always read good OO code should — only there’s a nice explanation as to why: If they didn’t operate on the object’s state, they wouldn’t be partially applied.
