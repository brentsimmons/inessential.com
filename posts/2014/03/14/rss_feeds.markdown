For a long time (at least a year) I didn’t have a visible RSS link on my blog, on the theory that people’s RSS reader would find the feed. But I learned that some people just assumed the blog doesn’t have a feed. It does: you can [subscribe here](http://inessential.com/xml/rss.xml).

(Yes, I do tweet some of the posts, but not all.)

Also: [on feedshare.net there’s a list of feeds I subscribe to](http://feedshare.net/inessential/). Good stuff there. (It’s slightly out-of-date: I’ve added a few since. But it’s a good list anyway.)
