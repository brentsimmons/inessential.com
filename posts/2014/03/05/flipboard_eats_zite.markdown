I never got into Flipboard. Great UI, but nothing I want to read.

Zite, on the other hand, has been a steady favorite. Zite’s UI is a little annoying, but the main thing is that it does its job well: it finds me interesting articles in topics I’m interested in.

But now Flipboard has acquired Zite, and the <a href="http://blog.zite.com/2014/03/05/zite-is-flipping-out/">Zite app will go away</a>.

Every acquisition of a favorite app brings its share of nervousness. But if this works out, we’ll have Flipboard’s great UI and Zite’s articles.

Reading Zite has been a habit for a certain period of my life, and I can’t help but be sad to see it go. Even if it’s going to a nice farm where it can run around all the time in the sun.
