We’re meeting at the Cyclops tonight at 7:30 pm for an unofficial westside Xcoders.

I felt like making a list of all the Seattle-area apps, because I’m proud of my area. Here are apps that were or are made here (to a substantial degree) or were born here or moved here.

[The Loop Magazine](http://www.loopinsight.com/magazine/) ([TypeEngine](http://typeengine.net/the-loop-magazine-launches-on-typeengine-platform/))<br />

I’m sure I’m not thinking of some apps (or just don’t know about them).

Most of these apps are represented at every Xcoders meeting. (Except for TypeEngine — I’m not sure I’ve met anyone from there. They’re encouraged to attend, obviously.)

Correction, later: [The TypeEngine folks totally did hang](https://twitter.com/DanielGenser/status/449339273062273024) out when Jim came to visit. Cool. Of course they should come out more often. :)
