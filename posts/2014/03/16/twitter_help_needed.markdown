There’s an [@inessential account on Twitter](https://twitter.com/inessential).

The avatar and bio are out-of-date. It used to link to articles from this blog, but it stopped working 13 Feb. 2013.

I’d like to update the avatar and bio and get it working again — but I don’t know who owns this account.

Clearly it should be me, and it *might* be me. I just don’t remember. I got as far with Twitter support as finding out it was owned by a Gmail address. I used to have a Gmail account, and it could have been me, but I really don’t know.

If you’re reading this, and you own that account (not a big stretch, I figure), please send email (brent at ranchero) or tweet me [@brentsimmons](https://twitter.com/brentsimmons). Thanks!
