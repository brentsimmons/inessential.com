Nick Harris, my co-worker at NewsGator and Sepia Labs, wrote a book: [Beginning iOS Programming: Building and Deploying iOS Applications](http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-iOS-Programming-Deploying-Applications/dp/1118841476/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1395368249&sr=1-1&keywords=beginning+ios+programming). Published by Wrox. Technical editing by [Kyle Richter](https://twitter.com/kylerichter).

For me it was a nice surprise when I looked at the table of contents and found that it covers not just table views, the camera, and maps but also web views, web services, and making a universal app.
