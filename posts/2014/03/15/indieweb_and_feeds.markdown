>If this [article](http://indiewebcamp.com/feed) about feeds on the IndieWeb wiki represents their philosophy, then their name is wrong — they’re not about independence, because feeds give us independence.

The article criticizes RSS and Atom for a few reasons, and those reasons are easy enough to swat away that I leave that as an exercise for the reader.

What gets me is where it notes some shutdowns: Google Reader, Apple removing RSS from Mail and Safari, Twitter removing feeds, etc.

For every shutdown of RSS feeds by a big company, an indie product such as [Feedly](http://feedly.com/), [NewsBlur](http://newsblur.com/), [Feed Wrangler](https://feedwrangler.net/welcome.html), [FeedPress](http://feedpress.it/), and [Unread](http://blog.jaredsinclair.com/post/75555794917/designing-unread) shows up.

<em>RSS is at its most interesting and useful when big companies ignore it.</em> It’s the domain of indie developers.
