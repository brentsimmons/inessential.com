Marcel Weiher: [The Siren Call of KVO and (Cocoa) Bindings](http://blog.metaobject.com/2014/03/the-siren-call-of-kvo-and-cocoa-bindings.html).

>You probably already figured it out: bindings are one-way dataflow constraints, specifically with the equation limited to y = x1. More complex equations can be obtained by using NSValueTransformers. KVO is more of an implicit invocation mechanism that is used primarily to build ad-hoc dataflow constraints.
