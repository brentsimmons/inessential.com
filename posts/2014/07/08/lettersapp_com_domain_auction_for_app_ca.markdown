I own lettersapp.com — but, since it was part of an open source project, it wouldn’t be right for me just to sell it and make a profit.

People have been asking if they could buy it. It’s not really fair for me to just sit on it, and it’s not really fair to pick a winner.

So I’m <a href="http://www.32auctions.com/organizations/15219/auctions/16878/auction_items/368292">doing an auction</a>. All of the money raised by the auction will go to <a href="http://appcamp4girls.com/">App Camp for Girls</a>.

The auction runs through July 15, 2014, 7 pm. <a href="http://www.32auctions.com/organizations/15219/auctions/16878/auction_items/368292">Bid now</a>! It’s a great domain name and a great cause.
