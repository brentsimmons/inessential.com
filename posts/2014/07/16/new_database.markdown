<a href="http://realm.io/news/introducing-realm/">Realm is a new mobile database</a> that I should look at.

While there are many options for server-side databases, for mobile it’s pretty much SQLite. (Core Data uses SQLite.) A few people may be using <a href="https://code.google.com/p/leveldb/">LevelDB</a> (which I’ve been meaning to look at). Perhaps some people are using <a href="http://fallabs.com/kyotocabinet/">Kyoto Cabinet</a>.

I love SQLite. I’ve been using it since SQLite 2.something. I’ve just about made a career out of it.

But if you asked me if we mobile developers should have more options, I’d respond with an emphatic yes.
