There is a pair of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papilio_rutulus">Western Tiger Swallowtails</a> that returns to the pine tree in my neighbor’s yard every summer.

It can’t really be the same pair, year-after-year, but it seems like it. It’s always two. I love watching them fly around my back yard. I don’t know what they’re doing, but it looks like they’re playing.

The closest thing to paradise might be the Pacific Science Center’s <a href="http://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/exhibits/tropical-butterfly-house">tropical butterfly house</a>. You walk in and there are all these butterflies.
