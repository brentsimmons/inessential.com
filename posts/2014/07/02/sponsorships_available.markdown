We have some openings for sponsorships coming up, including the week starting Monday, July 7. If you’re interested in reaching Mac and iOS developers and power users — smart people always on the lookout for cool things and cool services — then <a href="mailto:sponsors@ranchero.com">get in touch with me</a>.

More info — how it works, how much it costs, what weeks are available — appears on the <a href="http://inessential.com/sponsors">Sponsorship page</a>.
