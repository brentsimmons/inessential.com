>It’s possible separately via a web portal (not programmatically as far as I know), to configure a subset of data to be editable only by specific people, but the idea is more about providing a way for the maintainers of some data resources to update that data, than it is about providing a mechanism for users to create ad-hoc groups among themselves. (i.e. dynamic configuration data that’s loaded by the app at launch.)
