Other OS X radars filed today:

<a href="rdar://17567938">rdar://17567938</a> - I’d like an Info.plist key that lets me opt-in to having my app crash on an unhandled exception.

<a href="rdar://17567914">rdar://17567914</a> - I’d like a modeless presentation segue, suitable for things like Preferences windows.

<a href="rdar://17567893">rdar://17567893</a> - I’d like an API allowing the app delegate to get a reference to the window that was opened at startup. (It’s do-able, but it’s not straightforward, and it’s an obvious thing to want.)
