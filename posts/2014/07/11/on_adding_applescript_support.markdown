Me, writing in the latest objc.io: <a href="http://www.objc.io/issue-14/scripting-data.html">Making Your Mac App’s Data Scriptable</a>:

>Scripting isn’t a matter of automating button clicks; it’s about exposing the model layer to people who could use your app in their workflows.

>While that’s usually a small minority of users, they’re power users — the kind of people who recommend apps to friends and family. They blog and tweet about apps, and people listen to them. They can be your app’s biggest evangelists.

>Overall, the best reason to add scripting support is that it’s a matter of professionalism. But it doesn’t hurt that the effort is worth the reward.

The entire issue — <a href="http://www.objc.io/issue-14/">Back to the Mac</a> — is good. It includes articles by Craig Hockenberry, Gus Mueller, Daniel Eggert, and Florian Kugler.
