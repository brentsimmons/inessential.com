>Even though I managed to bring in a paltry $498 for a year’s worth of side-project time, it gets even worse. I paid nearly $700 in Facebook and Twitter mobile ads to try and market them. I also bought an iPad Mini and an iPod Touch for development and testing, so I’m even deeper in the hole overall.

I was wondering if games were different than other types of apps — easier to make a profit, maybe? Or harder?

This is just one developer’s experience, but if it’s at all representative then games are probably harder.
