<a href="http://www.anxiousmachine.com/blog/2014/7/29/the-price-of-great-software">Robert McGinley Myers suggests raising prices</a>:

>But when I look at that sales chart for Unread, and see that huge spike in the first few days, I see myself and other people like me, people who love these beautifully designed, “hand-crafted” apps.

>We aren’t buying these apps on impulse. We’re buying them because we read the reviews and we know what the best apps are, and we want to own the best. Maybe indie devs need to stop chasing the normals (who think everything should be free anyway) and just charge a fair price from the folks who care.

I think what would happen is that launch week would be even better — but every week after that would be <em>much</em> worse, in terms of both units and revenue.

Would you have bought Unread at $19.99? Or even $14.99 or $9.99? I don’t know if I would have.
