<a href="http://benjaminmayo.co.uk/unread-s-earnings">Benjamin Mayo</a> comments on Jared Sinclair writing about Unread’s revenue:

>In my opinion, you make money on the App Store by selling small things — its very nature is a bitesize marketplace. This is how you maximise your effective hourly wage. This doesn’t mean you have to turn around crap. <em>You can still output quality pieces of software</em>.

I think he’s right that this is a workable strategy.

The obvious downside, though, is that you don’t get apps like <a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a>, <a href="http://jaredsinclair.com/unread/">Unread</a>, <a href="http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a>, and my own app <a href="http://vesperapp.co">Vesper</a> (and plenty of others) if everyone sticks to this strategy.

We *want* those kinds of apps, not just the bite-sized apps.
