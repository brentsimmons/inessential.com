[Statiked](http://statiked.com) is a blog client for your static blog hosted on Github and S3. 

The online world has seen a new revolution lately: static blogs. However, as the current tools that are available to host and manage a static blog stand, it is only accessible to a minority of bloggers out there. Even seasoned programmers who use Github daily often find it difficult to write and publish a blog post. Statiked takes out all the pain points in publishing to a static blog. 

Statiked allows you to compose your article in your favorite text editor. Currently it supports, TextMate, TextEdit, Sublime Text 2, and BBEdit. You write all your articles in plain text using Markdown. Statiked generates the corresponding HTML before publishing it to the host.

If you are like us and donâ€™t want to leave the comforts of a blog editor which you are used to, Statiked provides an XML-RPC server built in. Point your favorite blog editor to the URL provided by Statiked, and blog as if you are publishing to any hosted blog.  

There are three beautifully designed responsive themes packaged within Statiked. With a bit of hacking you can port your Jekyll or Wordpress theme to use with Statiked too. Porting a theme is easy as Statiked supports the famous Liquid template system.

Statiked is a useful tool for any blogger who wishes to host a static blog. There are no bash commands to remember. No scripts to deal with. You do everything through a simple and intuitive UI. Publishing to a static blog is as easy as writing an email. Use your time to focus on writing. Write Just Right!
