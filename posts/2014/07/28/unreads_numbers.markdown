Jared Sinclair <a href="http://blog.jaredsinclair.com/post/93118460565/a-candid-look-at-unreads-first-year">writes about Unread sales</a>.

(I bought Unread about a month ago, by the way. It’s a very good app, and I recommend it.)

Contrast Jared’s numbers with NetNewsWire’s numbers in 2004 and 2005 (the last time I paid attention to its sales) — NetNewsWire made 5 figures every month, month after month.

This was before the App Store. It was a Mac app in a small market. (Far smaller than iOS, and much smaller than the Mac market is now.)
