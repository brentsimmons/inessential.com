I have, by accident, successfully set an inspection range in Instruments — and later I can’t reproduce it. This time I’ve figured it out for good, and so I’m writing it down.

Here’s how:

<a href="https://twitter.com/brentsimmons/status/532968932005519360">Record</a> for a while. Click the pause button.

Find the clear downward-pointing triangle above the graph. Click and drag it to the start of the range you want. Type cmd-< to set the beginning.

Click and drag that same triangle to move it to the end of the range you want. Type cmd-> to set the end of the range.

Done.
