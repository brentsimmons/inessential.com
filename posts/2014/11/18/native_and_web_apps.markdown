John’s article <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2014/11/native_apps_are_part_of_the_web">Native Apps Are Part of the Web</a> had me thinking about my own history of apps and their relationship to the web.

I fell in love with the web in the mid-’90s, and in the ’90s I worked on browser-based apps — Manila (a blogging system and CMS) most prominently.

In the 2000s I continued my love affair with the web, but I started writing native apps: <a href="http://www.netnewswireapp.com">NetNewsWire</a>, an RSS reader which downloaded feeds from the web and displayed content in an HTML view; and <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>, a native client for posting to browser-based blogs.

Later I worked on <a href="http://taplynx.com">TapLynx</a>, a framework for web publishers to create iOS apps, and then Glassboard, an iOS and Android group messaging app with a web backend (and even an HTML app).

These days I work on <a href="http://vesperapp.co">Vesper</a>, which syncs to a web backend, and <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a>, which syncs via WebDAV.

Each of these is a web app in the http sense. NetNewsWire and MarsEdit even had HTML views, and Glassboard had an HTML-based version. For Vesper I even <a href="http://inessential.com/vespersyncdiary">wrote a server</a>, which was the first time in a decade I’d done server-side work.

Which is just to say that the distinction between native and web apps isn’t a true distinction. Since native apps are also web apps, and since native apps may also use HTML, the true distinction is between native apps and *browser-based* apps.

And I sometimes think about writing browser-based apps. I’m not anti. They’re cool, and I might write one again some day.
