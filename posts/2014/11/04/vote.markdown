If you don’t vote, then everything bad our government does is your fault, and you don’t get to complain.

There’s no such thing as remaining neutral or sitting one out. There’s no not-playing-the-game. Not-voting is still playing the game. In a democracy you’re involved no matter what you do.

Worst case is when a choice is between the lesser of two evils. It’s easy to get cynical in those cases — but the greater of two evils relies on your cynicism to win. Don’t let it.
