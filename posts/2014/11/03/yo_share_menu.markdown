Extensions are cool.

I hadn’t looked at how to add a sharing menu to a Mac app — as in Safari in 10.10, or as in UIActivityViewController on iOS — until just now, and I find that I can’t find anything.

Is this truly not there? If so, then I’m surprised. I just took it as a given that it would be there, since the value of sharing extensions goes way down when only Apple apps can include a sharing menu.

Obviously I could build a sharing menu (as I’ve done before) — but I want a sharing menu that uses sharing extensions. Of course. Am I just missing this?
