I continue to be freaked-out about how bad is web performance. HTTP Archive says that the <a href="http://httparchive.org/trends.php?s=All&minlabel=Nov+15+2013&maxlabel=Nov+15+2014">average transfer is 1907K</a>, which is down just a little from last month, but still outrageous.

For comparison, my iPhone app <a href="http://vesperapp.co/">Vesper</a> is 5.0MB, which is less than three web pages. And you don’t have to re-download it every time you use it.

One of the strengths of the browser-based web is — or ought to be — that it’s lightweight. Going to any given site should not require an amount of data transfer that’s a significant fraction of downloading a native app.

The situation right now is crazy.
