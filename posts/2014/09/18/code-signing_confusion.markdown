Daniel Jalkut documents <a href="http://indiestack.com/2014/09/accepted-cdhash/">recent issues regarding code-signing</a>.

While WWDC 2014 was the best Christmas ever, and while the new iPhone models and the Apple Watch look very cool (I’ll be getting a 6+ and a watch), I still can’t help but worry.

What worries me these days is <em>bugs</em>.

Developers know what I’m talking about. To start listing them would seem like Apple-bashing, which isn’t my point.

Bugs make developers reluctant to adopt new things. A developer thinks: I’d love to do x, y, and z — but I think I’ll let everybody else go first.

I’ve said before recently that OS X 10.11 and iOS 9 could be about bug fixes and performance enhancements, and nothing else, and developers would be thrilled.
