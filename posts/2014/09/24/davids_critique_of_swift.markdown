In my <a href="http://owensd.io/2014/09/24/swift-experiences.html">My Swift Dilemma</a>, David Owens compares Swift to Objective-C and to a hypothetical Objective-C 3.0. And looks at the costs of optionals and generics.

David is disappointed, and not sure whether or not to be optimistic. I understand that. And while I’ve reserved judgment on a bunch of his points (not least because I have much less experience than he does), they’re well worth understanding — on the grounds that we should understand our tools and their decisions and trade-offs.
