It’s crazy to me that with interest in Apple at such a high, a publication that covers Apple couldn’t make enough money to retain its staff.

It seems to me that Macworld had a giant advantage over almost everything else.

Is it just that it’s hard to make enough money to run a quality publication? Even with the advantage of being Apple-centered?
