Macworld magazine has meant so incredibly much to me over so many years. And it’s not *really* closing — but they just let almost everybody go and they’re dropping the print magazine. So it’s finished as the Macworld that I loved.

More important to me, though, are the people I’ve gotten to know a little bit. Great individuals, great team. I feel bad for them for this very unhappy surprise — but I also have no doubt they’ll go on to do awesome things. And better things.

If we could deliver a standing ovation via internet as these folks leave this particular stage, we would. It’s so deserved.
