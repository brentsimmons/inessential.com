I wrote that <a href="http://inessential.com/2014/09/28/skillet_diner_ballard_considered_harmf">thing about the Skillet Diner</a> because I was insulted and angry about it the next day. (I’m not an angry person in general: this feeling is rare for me.)

But there are also some lessons to learn for software developers.

The first obvious one is to treat people with respect from the second they open the door — or from the second they launch your app. The first-time, first-run experience is massively important.

There’s also a second, less-obvious lesson.

The most charitable explanation I have is this: I said I’d be willing to sit at the counter, but I didn’t specify that I’d be willing to sit outside or at the bar. I figured I didn’t actually have to figure out all the different sections and specify each one to the host.

But the host knows the place: he thinks of the restaurant in terms of outside, dining room, counter, and bar. Whereas I, new to the place, think mainly of <em>just sitting down somewhere</em>. I’m no expert in that restaurant, having just arrived, but I was observant enough to notice some counters with empty seats together, so I did say we wouldn’t mind sitting there.

If my theory is correct, then the host expected me to treat him like a computer. He expected me to specify which sections would be acceptable, and he expected me to know all of them and present a list of acceptable choices.

But picture us: we were hungry, brand-new to the place, and we had enough experience to know that every other host in every other restaurant ever has managed to understand our wishes just fine — and has asked questions when needed, which is totally fine.

In other words, this particular UI was designed to be technically true but was entirely lacking in understanding of the (potential) customer.
