Radosław Pietruszewski <a href="http://radex.io/swift/methods/">makes the case for brevity</a>:

>Some people say that “clarity trumps brevity.” And they’re absolutely right. Except for the fact that brevity <em>can be a factor in clarity</em>. Verboseness doesn’t come for free…

>The trick in finding the sweet spot is to maximize the things that explain what the code does and remove as much <em>noise</em> as possible — the things that don’t really add information.
