In today’s mobile landscape, a lot of resources are directed towards building better quality apps — from beta testing platforms to distribution systems and even app performance monitoring solutions. But none of these solutions help developers while their app is in production.

With <a href="http://www.rollout.io/">Rollout.io</a>, developers can quickly react to their users by remote-controlling their app’s settings and parameters, as well as fix and contain errors and issues in real time — without waiting for a full release cycle. 

Capabilities:

* Contain & hot-patch production bugs
* Create analytics events on the fly
* Messaging 
* SDK toggling
* Advanced logging and debugging
* UI changes (buttons, images, etc)
