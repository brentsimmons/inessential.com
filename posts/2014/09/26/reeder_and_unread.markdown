I asked on Twitter about <a href="https://twitter.com/brentsimmons/status/514929400232808448">which iPhone RSS reader I should use</a>.

I got lots of responses. <a href="http://reederapp.com/ios/">Reeder</a> was most often mentioned; <a href="http://supertop.co/unread/">Unread</a> was second-most.

So I set up both with my syncing system (<a href="https://feedbin.com">Feedbin</a>) and gave them each a shot.

They’re good apps. As a user there’s a lot to like, and as a developer there’s a lot to admire. I can’t say that one is better than the other, or that one deserves more popularity than the other.

But, in the end, choosing was for me almost a no-brainer: I went with Unread because Reeder’s low-contrast UI (light gray on even-lighter-gray) was too difficult for me to read. Which is totally subjective, of course, and doesn’t actually say much about either app. But that’s my choice.
