>It is, however, a bit staggering to think that these numbers mean that there are around 300,000 apps on the Store currently that have seen an update in the past 3 months. It took over 2 years for the App Store to even reach 300k apps listed. That speaks to me of a very wide developer community clamoring for attention in the App Store.

The percentage of apps that donâ€™t get updates may be smaller than you think. Later in the article David Smith puts the percentage of effectively-abandoned apps at 40%, which is a smaller number than I would have expected. (I would have guessed 60%.)
