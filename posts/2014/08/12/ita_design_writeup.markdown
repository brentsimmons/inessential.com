The Mohawkians write up <a href="http://nicemohawk.com//blog/2014/08/a-case-study-for-list-app-design/">Ita 2.0 as a Case Study for List App Design</a>:

>With Ita, we’ve focused on the act of marking items complete (a single tap) and reordering items (a long press). This is because when you are using a list, these are the actions that you do most often.

The article looks at Reminders, Clear, and Wunderlist as well as Ita, and explains the Mohawks’s design decisions.
