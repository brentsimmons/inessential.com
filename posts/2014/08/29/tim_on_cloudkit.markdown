>That got me thinking about how CloudKit fits into this picture. As an iOS developer, CloudKit is immensely appealing at first glance. The API is low-level enough that you have a good deal of control over how your app interacts with the server. At the same time, you get a lot of server-side functionality for free, which leaves you with more time to focus on building a great app. But I still have a lot of misgivings about it.

I’ve <a href="http://inessential.com/2014/06/08/notes_on_cloudkit">written about CloudKit before</a>. It seems well-designed, and I suspect (though not based on experience yet) that it’s better-executed than earlier broadly-similar services from Apple.

We would have been tempted to use it with Vesper — but it would have meant, for instance, that we couldn’t do a web app version of Vesper.
