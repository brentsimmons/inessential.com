Mattt Thompson, in NSHipster, <a href="http://nshipster.com/swift-literal-convertible/">brings up a potentially controverial issue</a>.

This seems like another giant area for abuse and misuse. It worries me less than custom and overloaded operators, since it feels like something people would do less often.

And I can actually see myself potentially using the feature myself. Maybe.

But my criteria still needs to be: can somebody else read and understand my code?
