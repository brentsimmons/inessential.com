Presence gives you secure internet access to all your Mac’s files, from iPhone, iPad, Mac, or PC. That’s <i>all</i> your files — anytime, anywhere.

And you can share files and folders with others too. Send large files or provide access to a folder, all with the greatest of ease — just right-click, choose your options, and send a link.

You can even look through your Mac’s camera from anywhere in the world.

All this, and it’s private — your files live on your Mac, not on some company’s server.

Presence is <a href="http://thedizzyheights.com/presence/inessd">free to download</a> and has a two-week, fully-functional free trial. <a href="http://thedizzyheights.com/presence/inessw">See the Presence web site</a> for full details of an app that's worth getting to know.</p>
