We’re still running a summer sale for inessential.com sponsorships — $500 for a week ($400 for each of two or more weeks), which is about one-third off the normal price.

If you’d like to support this blog and talk about your thing (app, conference, service) to inessential.com readers — who are, to a person, successful, intelligent, and curious — then <a href="&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#116;o:&#x73;&#112;&#111;&#x6E;&#x73;&#x6F;&#x72;&#115;&#64;&#x72;a&#110;&#x63;&#x68;&#101;&#x72;o&#x2E;&#99;&#111;&#x6D;?subject=Sponsorship">get in touch with me</a>.

The week starting Sept. 1 (this Monday) is available — as are later weeks. See the <a href="http://inessential.com/sponsors">Sponsorship page</a> for more info.
