A parent I know complained to their school that using Facebook for organizing and communicating was a bad idea, since Facebook’s mission is to know everything about everybody everywhere, and she doesn’t really want to help them reach that goal.

The school agreed and switched to <a href="https://www.edmodo.com">Edmodo</a>.

Now, I don’t know if Edmodo is good or bad, but I do very much like the idea of services like this that can replace Facebook for specific uses. They can be *better* for those specific uses.
