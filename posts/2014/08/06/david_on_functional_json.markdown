I didn’t understand the article. I’m sure I’d get it on a second, much-more-careful read.

But this goes to a growing realization that Swift is complex — more so than Objective-C — and it’s going to take a while to learn it well.

That’s not a criticism, by the way. I expect I’ll value the things I don’t get yet, and it won’t be long before I’ll wonder how I got by without them.

I’m not the only one realizing this. <a href="https://twitter.com/collindonnell/status/496926752648994816">Collin Donnell on Twitter</a>:
