Gus Mueller suggests that <a href="http://shapeof.com/archives/2014/8/apple_should_open_a_seattle_office.html">Apple should open a Seattle office</a>:

I wouldn’t be surprised if the Seattle area is home to the largest Cocoa developer community outside California. And we already *do* have remote Apple employees here.

It’s a beautiful city and a beautiful region. And it’s progressive — we have marriage equality, legalized marijuana, and a $15 dollar minimum wage (well, coming soon).

Me, I’ve already got a thing. But if I didn’t, and I were looking for a job, and Apple had a local office, I’d strongly consider it. But I wouldn’t consider leaving Seattle.
