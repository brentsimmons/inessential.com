<a href="http://appcamp4girls.com">App Camp for Girls</a> came to Seattle, and I was lucky enough to get invited to the pitch session. (And Sheila was on the panel, which was very cool.) It was a big room and so there was enough space for not just the parents and camp counselors and volunteers but a few local folks like me.

The pitch session is kind of like the recital. At the end of the week, three teams of four girls each present their app. They talk about what it does and how it works, and they talk about competition, marketing, and how they plan to make money. (They all got the same memo about for-pay apps we did — the apps are free with in-app ads.)

It was *wonderful*.

I was a fan before, but actually seeing it — seeing the energy of the girls and the cool things they made, and seeing how happy (and happily tired) <a href="https://twitter.com/macgenie">Jean MacDonald</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/emarley">Liz Marley</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/knsontag">Kristina Sontag</a>, and all the volunteers were at the end of the week — put me over the moon. This is the coolest thing, by far, that’s happening in our community.

If you can help, <a href="http://appcamp4girls.com/volunteer/">help</a>. If you can <a href="http://appcamp4girls.com/new/2014/7/10/sponsor-an-app-camp-project-team.html">sponsor a team</a>, do it. If you can donate, <a href="http://appcamp4girls.com/contribute/">donate</a>. And, if you get so lucky as to get invited to a pitch session, go. Don’t miss it.
