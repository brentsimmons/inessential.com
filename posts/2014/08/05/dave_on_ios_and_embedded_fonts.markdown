>Retina screens have once again placed typography at the forefront of design, allowing us to breathe life into words themselves as imagery. It’s a damn shame we’re not given more room to do so.

Dave asks for the ability to use custom fonts in alerts, share sheets, under-the-cell buttons, menus, and so on. I want that too — I’d be able to work more efficiently and use standard controls most of the time.
