<a href="http://vesperapp.co/appstore">Vesper 2.002</a> adds a new feature — when you’re viewing a single note, tap at the bottom of the screen to see the date it was created. Tap again to see the modification date. Tap again to character or word count. (Character count if the note is short; word count if not short.)

Other changes include some small cosmetic fixes, fixes for a couple crashing bugs, and a change to how photos are synced: it syncs low-resolution versions first, then high-resolution versions. (This makes photos syncing faster.)

Vesper is still <a href="http://vesperapp.co/appstore">on sale for $2.99</a>.
