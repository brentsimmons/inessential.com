>Everything in Vesper has been animated <em>beautifully</em>.

When I read a review like this, I’m glad — and my mind goes straight to all the hours spent making those things the reviewer called out. Those animations represent a real chunk of my <em>life</em>. A chunk of my life spent learning, iterating, and cursing.

So. Much. Cursing.

I’ve never made anything where it was a breeze. Maybe some developers are like that, but not me. My one gift isn’t intelligence or talent — it’s just that I keep my eye on the end zone and keep going, one strenuous yard at a time.

Whatever glamour is, this is its opposite.
