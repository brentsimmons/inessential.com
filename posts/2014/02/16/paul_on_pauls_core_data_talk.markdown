>This talk was pretty much a <em>complete last minute change</em> from what I’d prepared and presented internally to <a href="http://blackpixel.com/">Black Pixel</a> coworkers two days earlier because I wasn’t happy with the boring textbook feel of that talk. If you don’t feel it was a polished set of slides, you’re absolutely correct.
