>Itâ€™s not just Cocoa. Every window system that ever lived suffers from something like this affliction. Either the system routes everything through the view (or the controller), which leaves a complex view looking like an old-fashioned switchboard operator, or instantiating a simple pane makes you create a whole slew of of handlers and delegates and thumgummies, and that drives programmers bats. Remember OpenDoc?
