I rediscovered yesterday that <a href="http://home.mcom.com/">home.mcom.com</a> has been preserved. I love that so much, and I wish more of the early web had been preserved.

Thereâ€™s a story behind it, of course. From 2008: <a href="http://www.jwz.org/blog/2008/03/happy-run-some-old-web-browsers-day/">Happy Run Some Old Web Browsers Day!</a>
