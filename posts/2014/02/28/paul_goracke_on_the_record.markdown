[Paul Goracke talks to me and Chris](http://therecord.co/2014/02/28/paul_goracke) on the latest episode of The Record — about contributing to CodeWarrior, the early days of Seattle Xcoders, and getting Think C for $25.

Somewhere along the line the words “disciplined Perl” are uttered, to the amazement of the interviewers.

<i>Update 12:15 pm</i>: [Paul writes on his blog](http://corporationunknown.com/blog/2014/02/28/for-the-record/) about being on The Record.
