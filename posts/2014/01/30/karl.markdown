In a [recent post](http://inessential.com/2014/01/29/dave_and_node) I suggested that a good business might be for someone experienced with both Cocoa and server development to do contract work for other Cocoa developers — to write their servers.

I got email from Karl Shea (who I don’t otherwise know). He’s working on [building such a business](http://weilstreet.com/services). He’s still learning iOS development, but appears to be already solid on server work.
