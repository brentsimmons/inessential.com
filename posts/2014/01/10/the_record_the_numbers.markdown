Chris and I can’t think of any reason not to share download numbers for [The Record](http://therecord.co/).

Episode #1 was released just over a week ago, Friday Jan. 3 at 3 pm. The podcast appeared in iTunes Tuesday Jan. 7.

(The following numbers are all as of this writing, of course.)

Downloads of the audio file so far: 5,355.

Our best day is today. Our second-best day was yesterday. Our third-best day was last Friday.

Earlier today it peaked as the #2 top Tech podcast, and reached #17 in all podcasts. (In iTunes. It’s down a little from then.)

#### Comparing to other podcasts

[Mule Radio Syndicate](http://www.muleradio.net/) posts download numbers for their podcasts, so we do have something to compare to. (They have a bunch of great shows, by the way.)

My goal for The Record was to land in respectable territory.

[The Big Web Show’s Dec. 19 episode](http://www.muleradio.net/thebigwebshow/106/) has 6,777 downloads.

[Let’s Make Mistakes Dec. 18 episode](http://www.muleradio.net/mistakes/120/) has 5,808 downloads.

So we’re in the same range as podcasts I admire. Good. (That is, if those numbers are actual download numbers. I assume they are, but I don’t know for sure. It’s conceivable that they’re just in-browser plays, though it’s hard to imagine that many people playing podcasts in their browser.)

Nevertheless, looking at [The Talk Show’s Dec. 24 episode](http://www.muleradio.net/thetalkshow/65/) provides some perspective: 66,470 downloads.

Welp. That gives me a goal.

*Update 6 p.m.*: [Daniel Jalkut says](https://twitter.com/danielpunkass/status/421806962268180480) that [Core Intuition](http://www.coreint.org/) gets about 10,000 downloads.
