It should be a good one. The next meeting is <a href="http://seattlexcoders.org/2014/01/06/january-9–app-store-sales-and-discounts.html">this Thursday</a>.

>Ken Case from the Omni Group will talk about the challenge of providing upgrade discounts through the App Store: why upgrade discounts are important, why the traditional approach to upgrade pricing doesn’t work in the App Store, and how Omni is providing discounted upgrades in their latest app release.

>John Chaffee from BusyMac will present tips and tricks for distributing apps on the Mac App Store including sandboxing, Mac App Store receipts, in-app update notifications, pricing, volume licenses, upgrades, affiliate revenue, and the controversial Rate This App dialog.
