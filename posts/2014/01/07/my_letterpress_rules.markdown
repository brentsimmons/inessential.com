I have just two:

When I win, I pass my first turn on the rematch. It gives my opponent a chance to go first, since there’s an advantage to going first in Letterpress.

I try hard to avoid doing a prefix or suffix variation of my opponent’s last word. Sometimes it’s the best possible play and I do it anyway. But in general I try not to.
