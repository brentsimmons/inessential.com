Last night the transfer for inessential.com was completed, and today the transfer for ranchero.com was completed. The nameserver settings went along with the transfer, so there was no interruption in service. Cool.

All that remains now is clean-up — I’ll try to delete my accounts from Network Solutions. Or at least delete as much info as I can. (Especially credit card info.)
