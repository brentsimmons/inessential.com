I suspect this is going to be a saga.

I started by going to Hover to see if they had instructions for transferring from Network Solutions. [They do](https://help.hover.com/entries/21240798-how-to-transfer-a-domain-from-network-solutions).

The first section has me disabling domain privacy on the Network Solutions site. I got as far as step #4, where I would click on Turn Private Registration Off.

But, of course, that link doesn’t appear.

Were this a normal situation, I’d email Network Solutions for help. But I don’t expect that to get me anywhere, so I emailed Hover for help instead.

Since it’s after 8 pm Eastern, Hover’s help people aren’t at work (understandably), which means I’ll have to wait until tomorrow.
