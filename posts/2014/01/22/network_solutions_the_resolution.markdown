[Domain Name Wire reports](http://domainnamewire.com/2014/01/22/web-com-weblock-program-will-be-opt-in-not-opt-out/) that the WebLock program will be opt-in rather than opt-out. The report also notes that the email was sent to 49 customers.

#### Phone Call

I got a phone call from Network Solutions, where they acknowledged that the wording of the email wasn’t good. They’ve had meetings about the wording of that email, the caller said.

I said that I didn’t want the feature. So the person who called me had a quick script to go through where I had to acknowledge that I understood what I was declining. The phone call took about two minutes in all.

#### My Next Step

I’ll be transferring my domain names. Probably to [Hover](https://www.hover.com/).

Over the past 24 hours I’ve had lots of registrars recommended to me. The upshot seems to be this: they’re all good except for GoDaddy. People recommend [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), [PairNIC](https://www.pairnic.com/), [Gandi.net](http://en.gandi.net/), [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/), and [Dynadot](http://www.dynadot.com/).

Which doesn’t give me a clear answer — until I take into account Hover’s long-time support of the podcast community. (I’m a listener and a podcaster. No, they haven’t advertised with me, and I haven’t asked them to.)

#### Questions

People have asked me a few questions (or had misconceptions):

*Do I host my sites at Network Solutions?*

No. They’re at DreamHost. (I’ve been there for about 10 years and they’ve been great. This site is fast. Of course, it doesn’t hurt that it’s a statically-rendered site.)

The name servers are also at DreamHost.

*Which domains were involved?*

[ranchero.com](http://ranchero.com/) and inessential.com (this blog). The email didn’t specify which domain would be getting the WebLock program. It could be both. I don’t know.

*What kind of traffic do I have that would get me noticed by Network Solutions?*

[Domain Name Wire reported yesterday](http://domainnamewire.com/2014/01/21/network-solutions-auto-enrolls-customer-into-1850-weblock-service/) that this service was going to “approximately 1 percent of Web.com’s customers.”

I have no idea how Network Solutions would know how much traffic I get.

My stats app Analog tells me that inessential.com had 2,270,357 requests for pages in December 2013, which was a typical month. I don’t know if this counts RSS feed requests. Presumably it doesn’t count images and style sheets and similar.

(I’m sure I sound terribly old-school by now: Network Solutions, DreamHost, and Analog. But that’s just because I haven’t felt a need to make changes. Until now.)

*Was I unaware that Network Solutions indulged in less-than-stellar practices?*

I was not unaware. I stopped registering new domains there in 1999. But I hadn’t felt it necessary to transfer my domains. (Not least because my time is best-spent writing code.)

#### The Internet Machine

So what happens when something so obviously inflammatory is posted?

[My initial tweet](https://twitter.com/brentsimmons/status/425717611947515904) was retweeted 293 times and favorited 47 times.

My blog post had the top spot on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7098383) for hours yesterday. It also appeared on [Slashdot](http://news.slashdot.org/story/14/01/21/2337242/network-solutions-opts-customer-into-1850-security-service) and on [Reddit’s Technology page](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/).

This blog got 2.8 times its normal traffic. (I don’t have ads. And I’d way rather people came here to read about something cool or something I made.)

I spent some time reading comments. My favorite — because I’m a software developer — was [this one](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7099733): “I was really pleased with the instantaneous load of this blog.”
