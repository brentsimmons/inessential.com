Andy Finnell’s [A Postmortem of Failed Products](http://losingfight.com/blog/2013/12/03/a-postmortem-of-failed-products/) interested me. (Via [Michael Tsai](http://mjtsai.com/blog/2014/01/08/fortunate-bears-future/).)

It reminded me of my first go at being an indie developer.

I started in 1995. I wasn’t much of a programmer, and I had zero experience designing, shipping, promoting, and selling apps. I had some indie heroes at the time — [Rich Siegel](http://barebones.com/), [Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/), [Chuck Shotton](https://twitter.com/cshotton), [Peter Lewis](http://www.stairways.com/main/), [Mark Aldritt](http://latenightsw.com/blog/), [Jim Matthews](http://fetchsoftworks.com/), [John Norstad](http://www.norstad.org/) — and I wanted to do what they were doing. Very badly.

I was working as a secretary at a manufacturer’s representative and I was in love with the web. I quit my job.

(The company — about a dozen people, mostly in the Portland branch — sold things like toothpaste, gift wrapping, hairbrushes, and so on to drug stores. Luckily I’ve forgotten everything I knew about the business, including the brand names. Most of my job was sending faxes. We had computers but no email.)

The apps I wrote all worked with [WebSTAR](https://web.archive.org/web/19970110180306/http://www.starnine.com/webstar/webstar.html) (the Mac HTTP server). I shipped three: [SpotLight](http://web.archive.org/web/19991021212201/http://www.ranchero.com/spotlight/), DenyAgent, and something. I forget what the third one was called.

*Total revenue:* $990

SpotLight cost $99 and I sold 10 copies. The other apps sold zero copies. Zeeeeeeeero.

Since those days I’ve never stopped shipping software.

#### What I Learned

I learned from that first go in the mid ’90s that I was a shipper, and nothing I’ve learned since has been more important. It’s the one necessary trait of an indie developer. For me it was like a fish being introduced to water — so *this* is what it’s like to breathe.

My apps were no good at all and I had no idea how to make money. None of that mattered.

From reading Andy Finnell’s piece it sounded like he did better on his first go than I did. And, most importantly, he’s learned that he’s a shipper. He can’t stop.

What I did next was to go work for UserLand Software (Dave Winer’s company), and I helped shipped a lot of software in those next six years, and I learned about the industry, about software, about how to treat people, about what works and doesn’t work. The experience I gained there is still paying off, and it’s what allowed my second go at being indie in the early ’00s — when I shipped [NetNewsWire](http://netnewswireapp.com/) and [MarsEdit](http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/) — to be successful.

Note to Andy, and everyone else in a similar spot: take heart. You’re a shipper. Keep learning and trying and everything else will follow.
