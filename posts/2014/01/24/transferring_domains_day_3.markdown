I went back to the Network Solutions site this evening to request a transfer code for inessential.com.

(It looks like ranchero.com is on a separate account. I don’t know why I did this — it was probably not intentional. But I’m confident Network Solutions support can help me figure this out.)

I’m following the instructions provided by [Hover](https://help.hover.com/entries/21240798-how-to-transfer-a-domain-from-network-solutions), and I got as far as requesting a transfer authorization code. Here’s where the process stops for a few days. Network Solutions’ site says:

>Your request for an Auth Code has been received and your information will be validated to ensure the security of your account. If your request is approved, you will receive your Auth Code by email in 3 days.

It’s Friday night. Hopefully this means I’ll get the code on Monday, though I can see that three days might mean three business days, in which case the code could arrive as late as Thursday.

I could wait, but I’d sure like to just get this all finished. I’ll email Network Solutions support and see if the code can be emailed to me sooner. (That might still mean Monday.)
