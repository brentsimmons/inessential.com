My co-worker Dave Wiskus is <a href="http://betterelevation.com/design-diary-1-groundbreaking/">writing about designing Vesper for Mac</a>:

>I’m excited not because the work will be easy; Mac is still not my core strength, and this will likely be the hardest work I’ve ever done. What I’m excited about is that for the first time the three of us — Brent, John, and myself — are all speaking the same language on the Mac.
