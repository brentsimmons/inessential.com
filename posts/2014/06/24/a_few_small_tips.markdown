Things you may not know:

To move any window without making it active, hold down the command key and drag its title bar.

To paste the path to a file you’re editing into Terminal, drag its proxy icon from the title bar to Terminal.

You probably know you can use ctrl-A and ctrl-E to navigate to the beginning and end of the current line in Terminal — but you can also navigate by word using option-leftArrow and option-rightArrow.

cmd-E copies selected text to the system-wide search pasteboard.

You can pop up Xcode’s methods list menu with a keystroke — and then start typing to filter down to the method you’re looking for. Makes it easy to navigate without searching or using the mouse.
