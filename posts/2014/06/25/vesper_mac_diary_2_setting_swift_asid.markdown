I’ve been writing Swift code. Not a ton yet. Probably not even 100 lines. I wanted to write all the new code for Vesper for Mac using Swift — but I realized today that it’s just too soon and I was too optimistic.

I like Swift. I’m not good at it yet, but I like it. A lot.

But here’s what happens:

Something goes wrong. I wonder if it’s a Swift bug. I wonder if it’s because I’m not a Swift expert yet. I wonder if it’s because I’m doing something (AppKit) I haven’t done in a while. I wonder if it’s a combination of two or more of the above.

I end up spending too much time this way, when I could move more quickly and with *much* less uncertainty when things go wrong if I stick for now with Objective-C.

This is not how I wanted it to go.

This isn’t a criticism of Swift, by the way — it’s not shipping, after all, and bumpiness is expected.

It’s just that I’m 14 years old at heart, and I really wanted to have fun rather than have to make a cold professional decision.

Well, there’s this: I was just being greedy. Writing Mac apps is so much fun that it doesn’t matter that I don’t get to use Swift yet.
