There’s a [meeting this Thursday at 7 pm](http://seattlexcoders.org/) at Omni. I’ll be doing a talk about Vesper syncing. I suspect that the talk may take a turn into a general discussion about CloudKit, Swift, and other WWDC announcements.

Afterwards we’ll go the [Cyclops](http://www.cyclopsseattle.com/), as normal.
