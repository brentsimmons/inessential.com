JavaScript is nobody’s first choice of language. (Almost nobody, maybe. There’s always a language you like better.)

But it’s everybody’s <em>second</em> choice of language — for the simple reason that everybody thinks that it’s everybody’s second choice of language.

(Maybe this is too clever to be true. Working on it.)
