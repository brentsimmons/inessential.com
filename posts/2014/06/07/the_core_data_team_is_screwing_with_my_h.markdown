I take it personally. I know that’s self-centered.

But look at what they’ve done:

* Bulk updates — solving the RSS reader problem of needing to mark 10,000 items as read all at once.

* Asynchronous fetches — solving the problem of blocking the main thread.

I don’t know what’s left for me to complain about. Good job, Core Data team.
