MacStories: <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/apple-posts-best-of-2014-app-store-and-itunes-store-lists/">Apple Posts “Best of 2014” App Store and iTunes Store Lists</a>.

Through absolutely no effort on my part, <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a> for iPad and for Mac are both on the list. (My work on OmniFocus for Mac isn’t shipping yet.) I’m so proud of the team.

And I completely agree with Threes as game of the year. I don’t play games very often, but I’ve been smitten by <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/letterpress-word-game/id526619424?mt=8">Letterpress</a> and, this year, <a href="http://asherv.com/threes/">Threes</a>.
