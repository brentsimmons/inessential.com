Your writing doesn’t come from a factory. <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/Specials/WinterFest.html">Neither does artisanal software</a>. 

A bunch of small, independent software visionaries have teamed together once again this season to bring you fresh, opinionated, and exciting tools for thinking and writing.

* <strong>Tinderbox</strong>: the tool for notes
* <strong>DEVONthink Pro</strong>: your Mac paperless office
* <strong>Scrivener</strong>: your complete writing studio
* <strong>Nisus Writer Pro</strong>:  the powerful word processor for OS X
* <strong>Aeon Timeline</strong>: timeline tool for creative thinking
* <strong>TextExpander</strong>: type more with less effort
* <strong>Take Control Books</strong>: the answers that you need now

No bundles or games or gimmicks; just <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/Specials/WinterFest.html">great software at a great price</a>, right at the vineyard gate.

(PS Brent speaking. This is the last sponsorship I plan to run on my blog. And it’s a great one. My entire career has been about tools for reading and writing — and so the developers behind these apps are my spiritual kin. Also worth noting: it’s not a bundle. Buy exactly the apps you want, for 25% off.)
