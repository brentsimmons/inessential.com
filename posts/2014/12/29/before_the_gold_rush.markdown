I ran across an old post of mine from 2008, before the App Store opened: [The Coming Gold Rush](http://inessential.com/2008/03/18/the_coming_gold_rush).

>One prediction — almost a gimme — is that we’ll see tons of to-do lists and Twitter clients.

Also:

>It’s possible the App Store will have user comments, but it’s unlikely that it will have high-quality reviews.
