I had a great time at [CocoaConf Seattle](http://cocoaconf.com/seattle-2014/home) this past weekend. I’m already looking forward to the [event in Yosemite](http://cocoaconf.com/yosemite) this spring.

I got to play a few songs as a Conditional Breakpoint! It was a total thrill for me. Check out the [Breakpoints album  on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/backtrace/id926558924) if you haven’t already.
