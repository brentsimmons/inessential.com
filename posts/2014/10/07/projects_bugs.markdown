I have a folder at <code>~/Projects/Bugs/</code> where I create test cases that get attached to Radars.

It’s a good practice. Assume you’ll have to do this sometimes, and assume you’ll want to keep those test cases. (You’ll want to keep them so you have an easy way to find out if they’ve been fixed in later releases.)

Sometimes in the process of creating a test case I find out it’s my bug. Sometimes. Either way, it’s a good exercise, because at least I find out one way or another.

(I’m procrastinating writing a test case right now. Hence the blog post.)
