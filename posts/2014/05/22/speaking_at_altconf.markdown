Unless the schedule changes (still possible, I suppose), I’ll be [speaking Monday June 2 at 2:45 at AltConf](http://www.altconf.com/speakers/). It’ll be about why we decided to build our own syncing for Vesper and how we did it.

My co-Q Dave Wiskus’s talk is right after mine, at 3:15. Convenient. That’s two-thirds of the branch in just one hour.

The entire speakers list is awesome, by the way. I would hate to have to choose between this and WWDC itself. (Well, I suppose I did choose, by not even attempting to get a WWDC ticket.)
