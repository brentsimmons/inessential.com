My fierce Letterpress opponent Jim Biancolo just shipped [Stand Up! The Work Break Timer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stand-up!-the-work-break-timer/id828244687?ls=1&mt=8). Itâ€™s a free iPhone app that reminds you to take a break.

You <em>should</em> take a break sometimes, by the way.

I think he uses it to remind him to play another devastating word against me in Letterpress.
