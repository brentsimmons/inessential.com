Since I’ve never used AdSense and don’t plan to, I’m not personally concerned about the <a href="http://pastebin.com/qh6Tta3h">alleged AdSense wrongdoings</a>. But then there’s this:

>They decided it was a good idea to alter the statistical data
shown for websites. It first began with just altering data reports for Analytics account holders that also
had an AdSense account, but they ran into too many issues and decided it would be simpler just to skew
the report data across the board to remain consistent and implement features globally.

>So what this means is that the statistical data for a website using Google Analytics is not even close to
being accurate. The numbers are incredibly deflated.

I *do* use Google Analytics, and had no reason to doubt the numbers. Now I wonder.
