I run across other people’s code — GitHub, StackOverflow, etc. — from time to time. One thing I often see is non-Cocoa-like abbreviations: txt for text, btn for button, lbl for label, and so on.

Cocoa style says to spell these things out. It’s worthwhile to check out Apple’s [Coding Guidelines for Cocoa](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/CodingGuidelines.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000146-SW1).
