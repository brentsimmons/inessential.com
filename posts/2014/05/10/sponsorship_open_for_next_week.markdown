We don’t have a sponsor for next week (Monday May 12). If you’re interested, [get in touch](http://inessential.com/sponsors) and I’ll make you a deal, since it’s late notice.

This blog is read by developers — especially Mac and iOS — and power users. They’re super-smart people: people you’d hire, people who like cool tools and conferences, people who like learning and reading.
