>In general, the UI within sync is intended to be as minimal as possible. It looks and feels like stock iOS whenever possible, seen through a Vesper-y lens. Some apps might use this as an opportunity to show off and have a little fun, but Vesperâ€™s personality is about minimalism and subtlety. Signing in or creating an account should not be a memorable process. Our hope is to make it pleasant, but instantly forgotten.
