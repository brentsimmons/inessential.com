My pal Charlie Wood’s app <a href="http://numerousapp.com/">Numerous</a> just hit the App Store.

It’s a dashboard for your numbers.

For instance, I can see my Twitter followers count (15,324), local temperature (76 degrees), elevation (194 ft.), Apple stock price ($590.78), atmospheric CO2 (401.31 ppm), and days till WWDC (31) all at a glance.

You can pick and choose, of course. And come up with new things. There’s a REST API.

Plus graphs.
