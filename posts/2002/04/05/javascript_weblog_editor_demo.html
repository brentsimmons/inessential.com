Just for jazz, and because I think it’s cool, I put up a <a href="http://ranchero.com/demos/weblogeditor.php">demo of the weblog editor</a> I use for this site and for ranchero.com.</p>

<p>It doesn’t actually let you change anything in the database, but otherwise it works.</p>

<p>It uses JavaScript to do a couple things I think are neat.</p>

<p>One is the Preview button. When you click it, it shows you a preview of the post you’re working on, formatted as it will appear on the home page. No round trip to the server required.</p>

<p>Another is the expanding/collapsing chevrons. I use those so I can glance at the titles to find the post I want to edit. Then I click the chevron to expand it.</p>

<p>When a post is expanded, then there are Delete and Edit links. If I click Edit, then the editing field at the top of the page is filled in—again, via JavaScript. No round trip to the server.</p>

<p>Anyway, you’re free to view source of course and lift any of the JavaScript code.</p>

<p>There’s also a search field, so I can search previous posts and edit or delete any. (It’s not a JavaScript thing; I’m just pointing it out.)</p>

<p>One thing you can’t see: when I submit a new post, the CMS pings Weblogs.com, and I see the text returned from Weblogs.com right there in the page. It’s a friendly little confirmation that the ping worked. Of course, sometimes Weblogs.com reminds it would be a good idea to take a break...</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: the JavaScript code may not work in your browser. It works in mine.
