Here’s what I’m thinking about today: a Web-based bug tracking system that’s easy to use and easy to set up. The systems I’ve seen are too complicated. I want something simple that has just what’s needed to do the job and no more.</p>

<p>It may be that such a thing exists and I just don’t know about it, of course.</p>

<p>The ideal system (for me) is implemented with PHP and MySQL, since that’s what I have access to. It’s template-based. It’s membership architecture is open so that it can be extended to be used with an existing membership system on an existing site.</p>

<p>Most importantly its interface should be attractive and easy. The idea is that people who use my software should <em>want</em> to report bugs and make feature requests via the system. I figure most people just want to report bugs pretty much the same way they do in email—just type something and click a button to send it. A big intimidating form is not cool.</p>

<p>As an admin I have to want to use it. I don’t want to spend a bunch of time classifying bugs; I want it to maintain itself. For me it should be much like a discussion group: I just want to reply to bug reports.</p>

<p>However, there should be some minimum attributes. <em>Which</em> product, for instance, is important. Type of bug is important. I might like to be able to set priorities. (Maybe. That might be too much.)</p>

<p>It would have to be searchable, of course. And a desktop client (which communicates via XML-RPC, naturally) would be nice.
