<a href="http://www.truerwords.net/articles/ut/optimalstringconcat.html">Seth Dillingham</a>: “UserTalk scripts often need to build large strings from smaller strings, such as assembling a web page or an RSS feed in Conversant, Manila, or even the old static site engine. In order to optimize this process as much as possible, there are two things the scripter needs to remember: ‘Avoid copying large strings whenever possible,’ and ‘trigger the secret in-place append.’”
