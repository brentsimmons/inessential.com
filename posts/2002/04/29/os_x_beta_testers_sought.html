I’m looking for a few beta testers for an app that will reach 1.0b1 sometime today or tomorrow. An OS X app, a Cocoa app, that’s designed to be fun. Not the world’s next killer app, to be sure—but I think (I hope) you’ll enjoy it.</p>

<p>If you’re interested and are willing to respect confidentiality, send me email (to brent at ranchero dot com) letting me know.
