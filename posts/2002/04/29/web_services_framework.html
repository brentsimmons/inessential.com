I read on a mailing list today that Apple’s planning to release a Web Services framework as part of the Core Foundation framework. It would be accessible to both Cocoa and Carbon apps, of course.</p>

<p>There’s a WWDC session named <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc2002/descriptions.html#804">Client Web Services Frameworks</a> that appears to confirm this.</p>

<p>From the description: “An explanation of important concepts and terminology is followed by an in-depth exploration of Apple’s WebServices.framework, a client-side framework for accessing Web Services from Mac OS X. Tools and techniques for writing Web Services glue and adding it to Cocoa, Carbon and AppleScript applications are demonstrated.”
