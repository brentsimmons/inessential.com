<a href="http://www.bergdesign.com/missing_cocoa_docs/">Brock Brandenberg</a>: “The Missing Cocoa Docs are intended to help you implement certain basic functionality and to teach you how to implement some of the more unique technologies like OS X’s superb glyph and type handling. For example, they won’t teach using NSViews because there are plenty of tutorials on NSViews and drawRect: methods, but there is little on NSLayoutManagers and accessing font outlines, a technique that is needed for more sophisticated graphics apps.”
