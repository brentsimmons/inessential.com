This pleases me immensely—Studio Log published a <a href="http://www.blankreb.com/studiogallery.php">collection of scripts</a> for my Big Cat contextual menu plugin.</p>

<p>If anyone else publishes scripts for <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/bigcat/">Big Cat</a>—and I hope you do—please let me know about it. I’d like to make a page that links to all the places where you can get Big Cat scripts.
