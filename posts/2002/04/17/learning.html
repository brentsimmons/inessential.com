I love learning, the actual experience of it, how you start with some new terminology and concepts, and some of it comes easily and other parts you just don’t get, but you keep at it, and you start to get things more and more, and soon you start to think in that subject, and further learning uncovers further depths.</p>

<p>There’s always a beauty to discover, however imperfectly realized.
