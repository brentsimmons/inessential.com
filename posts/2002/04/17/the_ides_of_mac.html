O’Reilly on <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/mac/2002/04/16/osx_java.html">Java IDEs for OS X</a>: “In this article, I’ll look at JBuilder, IDEA, and a few other IDEs. There’s a bigger issue here that I’ll address in the Pre-ramble: look at the number of choices you have for developing in Java on Mac OS X.”
