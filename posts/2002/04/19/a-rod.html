Less than three weeks into the season, the Rangers, who play in SafeCo field tonight, are already 8 1/2 games behind the first-place Mariners.</p>

<p>Do we still need to boo A-Rod? Or would pity be more appropriate?</p>

<p>Me, I like the idea of seeing 40,000 fans playing tiny, imaginary pity violins every time A-Rod steps to the plate.</p>

<p>Maybe it should be imaginary pity violin give-away night at SafeCo. Everybody who comes to the game gets a free, pocket-sized string instrument. (While supplies last.)</p>

<p>Or... on the other hand, maybe we should just boo him. 252 million dollars buys a lot of boos.
