O’Reilly: <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/mac/2002/04/19/cocoa.html">Programming with Cocoa</a>: “Today’s column is the first in a series that takes a closer look at a number of previously-neglected aspects of Cocoa’s document-based application feature set. The application we will build as a platform for exploring these concepts is an image viewer (and later an editor) application called ImageApp.”
