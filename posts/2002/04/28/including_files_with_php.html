<a href="http://www.phpbeginner.com/columns/chris/include">PHP Beginner</a>: “Another thing we can do is ‘include’ files. This comes in handy when you have the same information on all your pages, over and over again. For example, connecting to the same database, printing the same HTML at the top or bottom of a page. It can be used for headers or footers, or for simplifying things.”</p>
