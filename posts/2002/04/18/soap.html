Since I work for myself, I can choose to be impolitic when I want to. So I’m going to say something I’m not supposed to say: <em>I don’t like SOAP</em>.</p>

<p>(Simple Object Access Protocol, that is. I like the other kind of soap.)</p>

<p>I like web services. And I’m glad when they’re implemented and adopted, even when they’re SOAP interfaces. Something is better than nothing. The trend is good.</p>

<p>But while <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a> is a thing of beauty, SOAP should have been named COAP—<em>Convoluted</em> Object Access Protocol.</p>

<p>It just plain offends me as a spec. People claim there are things SOAP can do that XML-RPC can’t do, but I remain unconvinced.</p>

<p>It’s a shame that for a spec to be adopted in the “enterprise” it requires a level of absurd obfuscation. It’s almost like a continuing employment clause for programmers. If you choose the psychotic spec, well, they can’t fire you, because they’ll need you too much.</p>

<p>It’s like IT managers choosing Windows because it’s harder to maintain, so they know their jobs won’t go away.</p>

<p>All that said, I’ll still use SOAP when necessary, of course.
