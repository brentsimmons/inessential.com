Tonight I’m going to school for the first time in over ten years. I’m taking a continuing education class, elementary French, at the local community college.</p>

<p>I’m pretty excited about it. I’ve learned some French before, but my biggest problem is <em>hearing</em> it. Language is one of those things where to learn it well you need to learn with other people.</p>

<p>On a philosophic note: you’ve no doubt heard it said many times that the purpose of school is to teach you how to think, and that facts, the actual content of learning, are much less important.</p>

<p>I dispute that. Yes, school teaches you how to think—but the content of learning is hugely important.</p>

<p>Otherwise it’s like learning French without learning any vocabulary. You can’t communicate—you can’t even really think—without vocabulary.
