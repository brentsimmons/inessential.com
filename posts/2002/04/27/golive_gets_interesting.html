<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/2002/04/26/golive_history.html">O’Reilly</a>: “GoLive 6 features a robust workgroup server; support for common scripting languages such as ASP, JSP, and PHP; drag-and-drop WML authoring for mobile devices; MySQL database for dynamic sites; Apache Web server; and a tighter JavaScript code generator for rollovers and other dynamic goodies.”</p>

<p>For nostalgia reasons only: here’s a <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/simmons/firstlookatgolivecyberstud.html">review</a> I wrote of GoLive in 1997.
