I downloaded and tried out <a href="http://chimera.mozdev.org/">Chimera 0.2</a>, the latest build of the Mozilla-based Web browser with a Cocoa UI and Unix back-end. They write: “The plan is to produce only a browser (no other apps!), and to keep the UI as simple and as clean as possible.”</p>

<p>So far so good. No one claims it’s ready for daily use yet, but if they continue on this path, there’s a good chance it will eventually be my browser of choice—probably alot of people’s browser of choice.
