I want to provide an RSS feed of my Macintosh news aggregator. Since it’s an aggregator it gets news from other RSS feeds. It is very important that those other sources get credited.</p>

<p>So what I did was use <a href="http://backend.userland.com/rss092">RSS 0.92</a>, since it has a &lt;source&gt; element where I can put the name and URL of the source.</p>

<p>Here’s the <a href="http://ranchero.com/macnews/rss.xml">feed itself</a>.</p>

<p>Another option would have been to stuff information about the source into each description. That didn’t feel quite right to me. But then I suspect that not every RSS reader knows about the &lt;source> element. Hmmmm.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>P.S. This is another <em>searchable</em> RSS feed. Here for example are the search results for <a href="http://ranchero.com/macnews/rss.xml?q=applescript">applescript</a>. It seems to me that RSS is a natural format for search results, and I wonder why Google didn’t adopt it.
