<a href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2002/04/03/javaenterprise_tips.html">O’Reilly</a>: “I remember my first few years of programming when I knew that I was going to always innovate, always create, never copy, and never need any help. Of course, I later found out that most of my clever ‘innovations’ were poor solutions to well-understood problems, many with established ‘best-case’ solutions. It’s absurd to be so egotistical as to refuse to accept help when it’s offered.”
