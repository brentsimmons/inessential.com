Here’s an OS X app that would be useful to me as a developer: a resource inspector. Given that I can’t run ResEdit (since removing Classic from my machines), I still sometimes have a need to look at resources. I don’t need to edit them necessarily, but I need to see them.</p>

<p>So this app would provide an outline view, or perhaps a browser view, of the resources in a file and show me their values. The top level would be resource types; the second level would be ids; the third level would be values.</p>

<p>I don’t think I’m going to write this app. (I already have plenty of other things to do.) But I’d sure be glad if someone wrote it.
