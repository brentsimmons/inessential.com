I was wondering: how do you make XML-RPC calls from Cocoa apps?</p>

<p>It turns out that the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/Carbon/interapplicationcomm/soapXMLRPC/chapter4/Making_an_XML_RPC_Call.html">Apple Event Manager supports XML-RPC</a>. Thatâ€™s so cool. Any developer already familiar with constructing Apple events will find doing XML-RPC calls a piece of cake.</p>

<p>And of course the example used in the above page is the canonical betty.userland.com example, a nice touch which warmed my heart.
