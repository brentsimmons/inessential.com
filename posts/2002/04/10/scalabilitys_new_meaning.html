<a href="http://www.evolt.org/article/Scalability_s_New_Meaning/21/23896/index.html">evolt.org</a>: “The funny thing was that many developers were finding that their applications were able to support greater demand than expected. So much more than expected, that managers were becoming less worried about the scalability of their applications and more worried about the scalability of their development teams. What caused this apparent change in attitude? A law that has governed the computer industry since its inception caused this change.”
