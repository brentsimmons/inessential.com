I’ve been working on small-ish apps lately. Web apps and Cocoa apps. Here’s how I get started on a new app.</p>

<p>1. Define precisely what it does. I may or may not write it down—the goal is the feature list should be so small that I can keep it in my head without even trying. Also, the app should be describable in one sentence, even if that one sentence doesn’t cover all the features.</p>

<p>2. Sketch out the user interface. I use actual pen and paper. I may make several sketches until it’s right. A few days may pass between sketches as it gels in the back of my mind. The final sketch has labels and arrows so there’s no question of what does what.</p>

<p>3. Layout the interface in Interface Builder (if a desktop app) or with BBEdit and a web browser (if a web app). There may be iteration here, and I may have to go back to step 2.</p>

<p>4. Write a list of milestones. They should be simple, very fine-grained. The first milestone is usually just a do-nothing app that builds and displays the interface. The second milestone will do some small thing with hard-coded data. I’ll usually write down the first five or so milestones. I do <em>not</em> do a milestone list that takes me to the final product. Why not? Because I know to expect the unexpected. So what I do is add to the milestone list as I go along. I won’t know what milestone 10 is until I do milestone 5, for example.</p>

<p>I do fine-grained milestones because otherwise I get discouraged. I like crossing items off lists, and the more often I get to do that, the happier a developer I am.</p>

<p>I also use pen and paper for lists instead of a computer so I don’t have to switch out of my development environment to look at my list.</p>

<p>5. Now vee may perhaps to begin... In other words, get to milestone 1 and keep going.</p>

<p>I don’t necessarily advocate this process, by the way, I’m just describing how I personally get started on a new app. Note that I’m not working on a team or doing apps to someone else’s specs, both of which would require different processes.
