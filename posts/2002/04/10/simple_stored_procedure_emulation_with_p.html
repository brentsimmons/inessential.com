<a href="http://brentashley.blogchat.com/archives/000339.html">Brent Ashley</a>: “My ‘third time, automate’ rule came in handy again recently. I’m doing all sorts of PHP/mySQL work and I found myself hacking together the same SQL queries over and over with just some different filter or sort order. Being used to stored procedures, I was missing the easier syntax.”
