In some ways Cocoa reminds me of Frontier in that there’s (usually) an easy way to do something and then lots of hard ways to do something.</p>

<p>The problem is that the easy way is not always obvious. The other problem is that I forget the rule that says, “If you’re standing on your head to do something, look for the easy way.”</p>

<p>So I was looking all over for how to set up an NSSplitView—a split window, like that used by most email apps. I couldn’t find anything. There’s no NSSplitView in Interface Builder’s widget pallete.</p>

<p>Then finally I noticed that I could do it via the “Make Subviews of” submenu of the Layout menu. It was so easy. And of course it just plain works.
