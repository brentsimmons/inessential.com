One has to have confidence when learning a new thing. I’ve never considered myself a skilled graphics artist. I can design simple websites with okay results—but note for instance that there are no graphics used in this site’s template.</p>

<p>As a desktop app developer I need to be able to make new icons. Not just app icons, but document icons and toolbar icons. Normally I would say: oh shit, I’m screwed, this is way too far out of my areas of expertise. I’m a <em>text</em> guy.</p>

<p>But I’ve decided to have confidence instead.</p>

<p>Theory: if you’ve reasonably intelligent and imaginative, you can learn to do just about anything pretty well as long as you have confidence.</p>

<p>So I found this <a href="http://www.iconfactory.com/howto_home.asp">cool set of tutorials</a> at Iconfactory to get me started doing icons.</p>

<p>Who knows? Maybe I’ll end up not just okay at doing icons, maybe I’ll end up really damn good at icons. That would be a surprise for this text guy.
