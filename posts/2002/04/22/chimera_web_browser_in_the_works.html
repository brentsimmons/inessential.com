<a href="http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/0204/22.chimera.php">MacCentral</a>: “The Chimera project focuses on delivering a best-of-breed browser for Mac OS X, according to Steve Dagley of the project. It’s a ‘blending of the brains/brawn of the core technologies from Mozilla, such as the Gecko layout engine, with the beauty of Quartz text rendering in a Cocoa app,’ he said.”
