Theory: there are two types of cold wars on the Internet: cold wars where an intense PR battle is fought and <em>cold</em> cold wars where the entities do not acknowledge each other at all.</p>

<p>(A hot war on the Internet is where one or both entities do nasty stuff like denial-of-service attacks or selling a product at a loss in order to harm the competition.)</p>

<p>So one of my hobbies is cold cold war detection. Take any two entities that don’t acknowledge each other. Is there a cold cold war going on? If so, is it mutual or one-sided?</p>

<p>The trick is, any two entities may be quite reasonably indifferent to each other, and thus no war at all is going on. So it’s hard to be certain (unless you have inside information).
