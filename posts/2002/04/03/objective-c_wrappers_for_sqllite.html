Blackhole Media released <a href="http://blackholemedia.com/code/">SQLDatabase</a>, “a set of Objective-C classes that wrap around the SQLite library, an embeddable SQL database engine which reads and writes directly to and from database files on disk. This is very handy for developers who need some sort of flexible database solution. The SQLite library is public domain.”
