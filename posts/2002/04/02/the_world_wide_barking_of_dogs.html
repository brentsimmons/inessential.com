I always thought it was funny, the dog communications network. Iâ€™m walking along the sidewalk in my neighborhood and a dog starts barking at me. In sympathy another dog starts barking, which sets another dog to barking. Somebody in a house nearby gets a call from a friend in Chicago. Then dogs in Chicago start barking (since, with their great ears, they can hear the barking through the phone). The barking spreads all over the world in a flash. Then I cross the street to a block with no dogs. The barking all stops.
