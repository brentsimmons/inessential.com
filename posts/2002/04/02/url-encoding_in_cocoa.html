I was going ape looking for a URL-encoding method in Cocoa. To my surprise it appears to lack one.</p>

<p>So this post is here for the search engines. Cocoa developers: you can call <a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/CoreFoundation/URLServices/URL_Services/Functions/Miscellaneou39456789101112.html#//apple_ref/C/func/CFURLCreateStringByAddingPercentEscapes">CFURLCreateStringByAddingPercentEscapes</a> in the CoreFoundation framework to URL-encode a string. It takes (and returns) 
CFStringRefs, which are apparently interchangeable with NSStrings.
