My fledgling writing career is starting to take shape. I just turned in an article I had been assigned, and I pitched an article idea to another magazine (an idea that wouldn’t have been appropriate for the first magazine).</p>

<p>This is fun! I can’t believe people get paid for this.</p>

<p>Of course I’m still learning about the business side of being a writer. I’ve got a little spreadsheet that shows the status of articles and ideas, for example.</p>

<p>Got tips? I’d love to hear from experienced folks on, well, pretty much everything, whether it’s about writing itself or the business side.
