A couple more screen shots for people interested in scripting NetNewsWire pro. The first one shows the <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/scriptingClasses.jpg">scripting classes</a>; the second one shows the <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/scriptingCommands.jpg">commands</a>.</p>

<p>There are just three NetNewsWire-specific commands because lots of commands aren&#8217;t needed. Most of the good stuff is in getting and setting properties of subscription and headline classes.</p>

<p>Though this is all still very much in progress, I do appreciate any feedback one may have based on the screen shots above.
