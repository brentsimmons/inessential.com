This NetNewsWire pro <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/basicApplescript.jpg">screen shot </a>will probably make sense to AppleScript scripters only.</p>

<p>It shows a script getting properties of &#8220;every subscription whose RSS URL contains apple.com.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course you&#8217;ll be able to do more than just get data from NetNewsWire&#8212;but getting data is the easiest place to start, so that&#8217;s where I started.</p>

<p>Just so no one’s confused—the screen shot is of Script Editor. NetNewsWire is running but not shown (since its GUI is irrelevant to this screen shot).
