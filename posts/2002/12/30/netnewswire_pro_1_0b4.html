<a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/probeta/">NetNewsWire Pro 1.0b4</a> has just one change, but it&#8217;s a change lots of people have asked for. You can now display dates (and creators and subjects) when available.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/datesAndSubjects.jpg">screen shot</a> that shows Date and Subject columns.</p>

<p>You turn on the feature via the General preferences panel.</p>

<p>Dates (and so on) are displayed only when available. Not all feeds have this extra info. But it seems like more and more feeds do.
