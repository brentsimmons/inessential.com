I wasn&#8217;t planning for the first public beta of NetNewsWire Pro to include <a href="http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/rsd">RSD</a> support. In fact, I wasn&#8217;t sure I would do it for 1.0 at all.</p>

<p>But then the folks who make weblog publishing systems supported it so quickly and I realized&#8212;hey, RSD is here, time to do it. So this <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/probeta/">first beta</a> does indeed include RSD support.</p>

<p>(My thanks go to everyone involved in making RSD happen. Particular thanks go to <a href="http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/">Daniel Berlinger</a> and <a href="http://www.truerwords.net/">Seth Dillingham</a>, who worked hard on this spec.)</p>

<p>So why is RSD important? Sounds like just another R-S-something.</p>

<p>What RSD does is make it easy to configure a weblog editor to work with your weblog.</p>

<p>See, there are some settings you&#8217;d have to figure out manually, things you wouldn&#8217;t normally know&#8212;things you shouldn&#8217;t have to know, actually, things that are just important for your computer to know.</p>

<p>RSD takes away this bit of hairiness from the user and gets the software to deal with it. Which is at should be.</p>

<p>In NetNewsWire there&#8217;s an Autofill button. When you click it, NetNewsWire reads the RSD file for your weblog and fills in the weirder settings for you, so you don&#8217;t have to try and figure them out.</p>

<p>That&#8216;s why RSD is nice. It means you can be up-and-running quickly, rather than having to first go nuts. Better to skip the going nuts part.
