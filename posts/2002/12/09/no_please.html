Jakob Nielsen: <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20021209.html">In the Future, We&#039;ll All Be Harry Potter</a>.</p>

<p>Nielsen writes: &#8220;Much of the Harry Potter books&#8217; charm comes from the quirky magic objects that surround Harry and his friends. Rather than being solid and static, these objects embody initiative and activity. This is precisely the shift we&#8217;ll experience as computational power moves beyond the desktop into everyday objects.&#8221;</p>

<p>You have no idea how badly I want this to <em>not</em> happen.</p>

<p>I like computers, and even PDAs and digital cameras&#8212;but I like that most objects are dumb as rocks. They can&#8217;t see and they can&#8217;t talk.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m all, leave me alone, you <em>things</em>.</p>

<p>And the things all go&#8212;hey, we just want to <em>help</em> you, Brent. We got smart because we love you.</p>

<p>And I&#8217;m all, where&#8217;s my rubber mallet?
