One of the most common bug reports for NetNewsWire is that, when a drawer opens, it can be hidden if the main window is already almost as wide as the screen.</p>

<p>Some apps&#8212;OmniWeb, for example&#8212;deal with this nicely by shrinking the main window. Other apps&#8212;Mail, for example&#8212;don&#8217;t do anything about this issue.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m utterly pleased to report that NetNewsWire, in the next release, will work more like OmniWeb than Mail. It will shrink the window when needed to make room for the drawer.</p>

<p>One might argue that Cocoa should do this automatically, and I might agree.
