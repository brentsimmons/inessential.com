Maybe some of the Cocoa programmers in the audience have the answer to this question.</p>

<p>How do I get the spell checker to ignore HTML tags? I note that Mail does it, for instance. But a generic NSTextView does not.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve combed the list archives at <a href="http://cocoa.mamasam.com/">cocoa.mamasam.com</a> etc. etc., but I&#8217;ve found no answers yet.</p>

<p>The idea is that the spell checker in NetNewsWire Pro&#8217;s weblog editor should ignore HTML tags.
