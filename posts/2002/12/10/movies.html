I saw a couple movies recently.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.solaristhemovie.com/">Solaris</a> is like if Philip Dick wrote chick flicks. What is real? What is human? What is love? Etc.</p>

<p>It has all the makings of a great story, and is very beautiful to look at at times, but it&#8217;s a bit slow too. My eyes slipped briefly shut a couple times. And this was after four or five cups of coffee and a Split Decision breakfast (pancakes, French toast, bacon, and sausage) at IHoP.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to read the <a href="http://cyberiad.info/english/main.htm">book</a> it was based on.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jamesbond.com/">Die Another Day</a> is my favorite Bond movie since the Connery days.</p>

<p>Totally fun. Great locations and effects. Good story, good villains, good tech. It even has <em>fencing</em>.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t expect Halle Berry to be good, but she was. I could imagine a spinoff movie with her and her character (Jinx, the NSA agent).</p>

<p>One misses Q, of course, but now there&#8217;s John Cleese as the new Q, and, well, there&#8217;s never enough John Cleese on the silver screen.
