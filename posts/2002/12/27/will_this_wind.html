&#8220;Will this wind be so mighty as to lay low the mountains of the Earth?&#8221;</p>

<p>Actually, I think it&#8217;s possible. It&#8217;s <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/134603734_windy27m.html">quite windy</a> here today in the northwest.</p>

<p>I like wind about as much as I like unnecessary surgery.</p>

<p>Nuts.
