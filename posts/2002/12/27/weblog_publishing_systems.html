NetNewsWire Pro has a pop-up menu of weblog publishing systems. When you&#8217;re configuring NetNewsWire to post to your weblog, you choose the software you&#8217;re using.</p>

<p>My intent is to list all systems that support one or both of the Blogger API and MetaWeblog API or are Blosxom-compatible.</p>

<p>In the next release I&#8217;ll add <a href="http://www.antville.org/">Antville</a> and <a href="http://cafelog.com/">b2</a> to the list. Current systems listed are Blogger, Blosxom, Conversant, Drupal, Manila (News Items), Movable Type, pMachine, Radio UserLand, and SnipSnap.</p>

<p>What other systems should be added? Are any missing from the list?
