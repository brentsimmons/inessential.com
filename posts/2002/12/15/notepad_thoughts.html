A number of people have asked me what&#8217;s the deal with the Notepad in NetNewsWire Pro. The RSS reader makes sense, of course, and so does the Weblog editor. But why an outliner too? And what&#8217;s the deal with attachments?</p>

<p>While it&#8217;s ultra-clear to me, I&#8217;m still working on finding the most effective way to explain it. This <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/notepadThoughts.jpg">screen shot</a> shows my most recent thoughts.
