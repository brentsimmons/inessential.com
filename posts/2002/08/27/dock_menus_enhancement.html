The next beta of NetNewsWire will have a new feature—an organized Dock menu, with sub-menus for each subscription with unread news. Here’s a <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/dockSubmenus.jpg">screen shot</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this is a Jaguar-only feature: 10.1.x users will continue to get the flat Dock menu. (It’s because of a change in the system that I’m able to do this feature for Jaguar.)
