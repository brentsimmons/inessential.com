I’m not much for chat. But I’ve been seeing that other developers are doing chat sessions with their users about their software—to handle support, bug reports, feature requests, answer questions, etc.</p>

<p>So I thought I’d try out iChat (now that I’m Jaguar-ified).</p>

<p>But... do I understand correctly that I have to pay somebody some money? It appears that one needs either an AOL or .Mac account. True? Or is there some way around the requirement that I open my wallet that I just haven’t realized?</p>

<p><em>Update 11:45 a.m.:</em> Thanks to <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=2091">Eric Tilton’s help</a> I have signed up for a free AIM account. Cool. My screen name is pbrentsimmons. (The “p” stands for Peter, my first name.)
