The LA Times magazine has published an article on <a href="http://www.latimes.com/features/printedition/magazine/la-080402seattle.story?coll=la%2Dheadlines%2Dmagazine%2Dmanual">The Decline and Fall of Seattle</a> (free registration required).</p>

<p>I’ve just skimmed it so far. (I live in Seattle, by the way.)</p>

<p>Here’s a quote: “Despite the boom, Seattle always seemed of two minds on the new economy. With its blue-collar Boeing roots, its long line of stern Scandinavian loggers and fishermen, its suspicion of ostentation, the city spent the ’90s getting used to the new big thinkers—people like Glaser, Howard Schultz at Starbucks and Jeff Bezos at Amazon.com—embracing them, really, while wondering if it should be holding its nose.”
