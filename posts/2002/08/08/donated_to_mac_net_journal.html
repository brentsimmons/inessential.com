I donated $20 to <a href="http://www.whiterabbits.com/MacNetJournal/">Mac Net Journal</a> today. Rob’s doing a great job with this site—his weblog has become my primary site for Mac news. So what’s $20 to help keep Mac Net Journal going? A large pizza and some cokes or a couple pitchers of beer. It’s totally worth it.
