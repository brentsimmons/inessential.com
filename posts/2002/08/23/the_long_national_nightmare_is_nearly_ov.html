The long national nightmare is nearly over—my copy of Jaguar is apparently en route, on a truck right now, finding its way to my house.</p>

<p>I had pre-ordered it from outpost.com because they were selling it for $30 less than everybody else. They said it would ship the 24th.</p>

<p>On a whim I just checked my order status and found that it’s out for delivery right now. Cool.</p>

<p>During pretty much the entire development of NetNewsWire I’ve been getting Jaguar-specific bug reports—but I, seemingly alone in the Mac geek universe, didn’t have a copy of Jaguar.</p>

<p>The main reason I’m looking forward to it is by all accounts it’s <em>faster</em>. Speed is good. It could be exactly the same as 10.1 but be faster and I would be satisfied.
