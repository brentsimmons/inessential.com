Ben Hammersley <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,781838,00.html">writes</a> in the UK Guardian: “I don’t mean to brag but it’s 8.30am and I’ve already got up to date with 75 different websites. I’ve read all their headlines, perused the articles of interest, and I’m only half way through my coffee.”
