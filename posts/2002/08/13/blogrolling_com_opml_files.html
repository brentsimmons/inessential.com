I’m seeking Blogrolling.com OPML files to make sure they’re supported by NetNewsWire. So if you have one—or more than one, the more the better—and if you don’t mind sharing, please email them to me at brent at ranchero dot com or let me know a download URL. Thanks!</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> I have enough Blogrolling.com files now. Thanks to all who sent them.</p>

<p>Here’s the problem, however—Blogrolling.com OPML files do not contain RSS URLs, so importing them as NetNewsWire subscription won’t work. Total bummer.
