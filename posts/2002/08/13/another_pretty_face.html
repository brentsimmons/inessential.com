The early ’70s was the glam era, the Ziggy Stardust era, when it was fashionable to be both gay and from outer space. It was the era of T. Rex, Mott the Hoople, Roxy Music... and Another Pretty Face.</p>

<p>Another Pretty Face? Okay, they didn’t hit it big, so you probably never heard of them. They were my uncle’s band. If you were a college student in Pennsylvania or New York in those days you may have seen them. Maybe.</p>

<p>My uncle once told me a story about how, after a gig in New York City featuring several bands, they were all sitting around drinking and talking.</p>

<p>A guy from one of the other bands was saying how much they loved Another Pretty Face, how they thought the act was so cool—especially the whole boys-wearing-makeup thing.</p>

<p>We gotta try that, said the guy. He seemed really hyped. Gotta do the makeup thing.</p>

<p>(Surely you can see the punchline coming?)</p>

<p>The guy was from KISS, a pre-makeup KISS, KISS before anyone knew who they were.</p>

<p>So at long last I reveal my secret family shame.
