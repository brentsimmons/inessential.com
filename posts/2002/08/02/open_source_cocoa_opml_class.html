What’s <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/opmlviewer.jpg">this</a>?</p>

<p>It’s a screen shot of a test app for a Cocoa class that parses OPML files. The OPML class I developed for NetNewsWire—so that it could import subscriptions files—is now <a href="http://ranchero.com/cocoa/opml/">available as Open Source</a> (BSD license).</p>

<p>Of course, the more interesting use for OPML is web directories. This little test app has everything you need to get started on creating a cool directory browser—it shows not just how to parse OPML but how to hook it up to an outline view and how to make headlines double-clickable (so they open in the browser). Very simple. I hope someone takes it and runs with it.</p>

<p>Note that it’s <em>not</em> an OPML editor, just a reader. Creating a mutable OPML class is left as an exercise.
