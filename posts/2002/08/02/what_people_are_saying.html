I’m no great marketer, but I figured I’d do a <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/quotes.php">what people are saying</a> page for NetNewsWire.</p>

<p>My favorite quote is the one that appears at the bottom from Sunil Doshi of <a href="http://widepipe.org/000193.shtml">widepipe.org</a>:</p>

<p>“Finding a good OS X RSS reader is more difficult than I thought it would be. Most that I’ve tried are ugly, complicated, and buggy. But NetNewsWire is pretty, simple, and only slightly buggy.”
