<a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire Lite 1.0b14</a> supports RSS discovery.</p>

<p>What this means in plain English is that, when you go to manually subscribe to a site, you can type just its URL, or even just a domain like www.someblog.com, and NetNewsWire will without fuss go ahead and find the RSS feed for you.</p>

<p>It doesn’t always work, unfortunately, but it works a great deal of the time. And it’s oddly addicting. (At least for me the developer.) Last night I spent some time going through the list of weblogs at <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/">weblogs.com</a> just trying one site after another looking for RSS feeds. I found tons.
