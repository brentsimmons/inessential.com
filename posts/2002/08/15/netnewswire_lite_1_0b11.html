Get it while it’s hot! And note the cool new icon by the fabulous <a href="http://www.bryanbell.com/">Bryan Bell</a>.</p>

<p>This release is very much the result of user feedback. The most common request was for the ability to group subscriptions and have multiple aggregate views. That’s there.</p>

<p>Another common request was that the first item shouldn’t be automatically selected (thereby marking it as read). Done.</p>

<p>Yet another request was for the ability to close the main window. Also done.</p>

<p>Rather than go on, let me refer you to the <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/changenotes.php">change notes</a>.
