<a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire Lite 1.0b15</a> improves its RSS discovery feature—it consults its built-in list of sites (that appear in the Sites drawer) when looking for a site’s RSS feed.</p>

<p>You can also now import <a href="http://www.blogrolling.com/">Blogrolling.com</a> OPML files. It will try to find the RSS feeds for sites that you import.</p>

<p>A bunch of weblogs were added to the Sites drawer.
