I think I’ve seen the future, or a small part of it, regarding weblogs. Two things:</p>

<p>1. If you’re not syndicating your site as RSS it might as well not exist.</p>

<p>2. If you don’t include a &lt;link...&gt; tag in your home page that points to your RSS feed, then you might as well not be syndicating your site, and therefore it might as well not exist.
