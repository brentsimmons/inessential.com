The next beta of NetNewsWire Lite (probably a few days away) will support a new feature: groups.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to organize your feeds via drag-and-drop. When you select a group, then all the unread items in all the feeds in that group are displayed. This way you can have multiple aggregate views.</p>
