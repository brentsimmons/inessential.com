If you’re brave, and you want to try something rough and weird and experimental, check out this <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/blogoscope10d3.jpg">screen shot</a>.</p>

<p>On the left is the most recently updated weblogs as reported by <a href="http://www.weblogs.com">Weblogs.com</a>. On the right is the page corresponding to the selected weblog.</p>

<p>If nothing else, it’s an interesting test of OS X’s built-in HTML renderer. I’m not sure if I’ll continue with this bit of software or not, given the bugs with the renderer. (Which will be fixed someday, perhaps? I don’t know.)</p>

<p>You can download <a href="http://ranchero.com/downloads/Blogoscope1.0d3.sit">Blogoscope 1.0d3</a> if you’re brave. I don’t think anyone would actually want to use it in the state it’s in though.
