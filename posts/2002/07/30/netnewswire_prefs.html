The prefs window for NetNewsWire Lite was getting unwieldy—so I spent yesterday getting it to work like Mail.app and Project Builder. Here’s a <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/netNewsWirePrefs.jpg">screen shot</a>. Now it’s cleaner and the window fits on machines (such as old iBooks) with smaller screens.</p>

<p>I had the hardest time coming up with an icon for the proxy settings. What image means “proxy?” Then I changed the name to “Proxy Server” and it was obvious—it should be a server. So the icon is the left-hand corner of an Xserve box.
