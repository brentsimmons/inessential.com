If anyone who’s running OS X 10.2 could lend me a hand with a quick test, I’d appreciate it.</p>

<p>Some 10.2 users have reported a crash-on-startup bug with NetNewsWire Lite. I think I’ve fixed it, but I don’t have 10.2 to test with.</p>

<p>Here’s what to do: <a href="http://ranchero.com/downloads/NetNewsWireLite10.2Special.sit">download this special build</a>, launch NetNewsWire, and then email me (to brent at ranchero dot com) reports of success or failure. (Both types of reports are important.)</p>

<p>Naturally I will keep the fact that you’re running 10.2 confidential.</p>

<p>Thanks!
