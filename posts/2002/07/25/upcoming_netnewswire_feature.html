This <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/aggregateFeed.jpg">screen shot</a> shows a much-asked-for NetNewsWire feature in progress—a special feed that contains just new headlines. An aggregate view, in other words. Though it will be off by default, you’ll be able to turn it on just by clicking a checkbox in the Preferences panel.</p>

<p>I’m shooting for a Friday release.
