I love crash logs. I collect them. A crash log in my inbox is like a birthday present. Two crash logs is like Christmas. Three crash logs is like... well, something good that’s even better than Christmas.</p>

<p>I got two crash logs yesterday. One was pretty much worthless: no useful information. (Though the user’s description of what happened was helpful.)</p>

<p>The other crash log was a thing of beauty—one of those wonderful logs that hit you on the head and say, “Dude! The bug’s right here! And it’s easy to fix, too!”</p>

<p>Developers—you know what I’m talking about, right? You know how a good crash log can make your day.
