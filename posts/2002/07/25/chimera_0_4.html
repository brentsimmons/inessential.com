A new version of <a href="http://chimera.mozdev.org/installation.html">Chimera</a> has been posted.</p>

<p>I noticed that it can now function as one’s default web browser—it will open URLs when requested by other applications.</p>

<p>For NetNewsWire users, that means NetNewsWire can open URLs with Chimera (if it’s your default browser).</p>

<p>And there’s an additional cool feature—you can tell Chimera to open URLs in a new tab (instead of a new window) when requested by another application (such as NetNewsWire). Very nice.</p>

<p>Open the Preferences panel, click on Navigation, then click on the Tabbed Browsing tab. Then check the box next to “Loading a page requested by another application.”
