Should I create a separate mailing list for the NetNewsWire Pro beta?<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NetNewsWire/surveys?id=131152"></p>

<p>I set up a poll</a> on Yahoo Groups.</p>

<p>Arguments in favor of creating a new list: it may get a bit of traffic at times, and it will be off-topic for people who aren’t into beta-testing.</p>

<p>Arguments against creating a new list: one list is easier to follow. People don’t have to sign up for yet another mailing list.
