I’ve written up a preliminary spec for AppleScript and OSA <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/applescript.php">scripting support in NetNewsWire</a> (the pro version).</p>

<p>Feedback is totally appreciated, of course.</p>

<p>By the way, I got a start on the implementation: last night I added a Scripts menu to the application and today I got started on the scripting dictionary.</p>

<p>I’m very pleased to note that adding scripting support is much easier than it used to be. It’s gotten to the point where the design, not the implementation, is the challenge—which is as it should be.</p>

<p>Also: when I have some spare time I’ll post a tutorial with source code on adding a Scripts menu to any Cocoa application. It’s easy. (And this code will make it even easier.) But it may be a few days or weeks before I get to it.
