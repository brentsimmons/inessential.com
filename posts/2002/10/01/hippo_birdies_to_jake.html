Happy Birthday to <a href="http://jake.userland.com/2002/10/01.html#a750">Jake</a>!</p>

<p>Y’all wouldn’t know it, but Jake calls me up now and again to ask questions about the kernel, or some scripts, or whatever—and I’m always glad to hear from him. I get the chance to catch up on UserLand and on what Jake’s been up to, and that’s always cool.</p>

<p>And so I think to myself: Jake is lucky to work at UserLand. He’s lucky to have found a job that fits him so well and that he does so well.</p>

<p>And then I think: well, <em>UserLand</em> is lucky to have <em>Jake</em>. Jake’s a guy you want on your team.
