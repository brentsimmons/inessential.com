<a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2002/10/04.html#a434">Jon Udell</a>: “It all adds up to one more piece of evidence supporting my hypothesis that we are about to enter a golden age of desktop software. Things have been crashingly dull on that front for many years now. I contend that Web services will revitalize things. Desktop apps aren’t just connecting the user to the local filesystem anymore, they’re connecting the user to the cloud, where all the innovation is happening. How that connection is made is about to become a hugely important piece of the innovation.”
