I’ve always been fascinated how people tend to live in one particular application.</p>

<p>Some people might live in Word or Excel. People used to live in HyperCard. (Some probably still do.) Some people live in Frontier. Lots of webloggers probably live in their Web browser. The more gregarious types probably live in their chat program or their email app.</p>

<p>By “live in” I mean the app that feels like home, the app where you spend most of your time.</p>

<p>Me, I’ve been living in Project Builder (unsurprisingly) for the last half-year or so.</p>

<p>What app do you live in? And why? I’m curious.
