A common feature request for NetNewsWire is that I add feeds that happen to be screen-scraped and that are done without the owner’s explicit permission.</p>

<p>(CNN and VersionTracker are the most common requests.)</p>

<p>I won’t do it for a couple reasons:</p>

<p>1. Screen-scraped feeds are prone to breakage if the owner of the site changes the layout of their site.</p>

<p>When that happens, who do you think well get the bug report? (Answer: me.)</p>

<p>2. There are probably some legal issues here.</p>

<p>Even if there aren’t, it’s still possible that a given screen-scraped site has lawyers who want to make a legal issue of it anyway. You can imagine how reluctant I am to end up in court.</p>

<p>And so, a reminder—if a site doesn’t offer an RSS feed, you can always send them email and (politely, of course) ask them if they would consider RSS.</p>

<p>They may not even know what it is, or they may not understand the benefit of it.</p>

<p>My contention is that RSS brings a site more visitors—for instance, I actually visit <em>more</em> sites now that I have a way to scan through the headlines of >100 sites. An RSS feed is like an advertisement, in a way. (Perhaps you can make the case better than I can; hopefully you get my meaning.)</p>

<p>And if it’s a weblogger you’re asking to support RSS, offer to help. Said weblogger may not realize how to turn on RSS, or they may need a little scripting help. When you’re asking for a favor, offer a favor in return. Be generous.
