My pick for the greatest desktop application of all time is <a href="http://www.outliners.com/more31">MORE</a>.</p>

<p>Not only for what it does—it’s an outliner—but for its user interface. It feels so right and good.</p>

<p>When I’m working on user interface it’s the je-ne-sais-quoi of MORE I aspire to. Getting that light, fast, and <em>so right</em> feeling is the goal.</p>

<p>What’s your pick for greatest desktop app of all time?
