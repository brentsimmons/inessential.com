I’m just about finished writing a second article for MacTech on developing contextual menu plugins for OS X.</p>

<p>I’d like to have a couple knowledgeable OS X developers review it before I submit it—but, of course, I’d like to submit it tomorrow.</p>

<p>So, if you have interest and can read it this afternoon or tonight, please send me email (to brent at ranchero dot com) and I’ll email you the article. (And of course I’ll also thank you for your help in the article itself.)</p>

<p>Thanks!
