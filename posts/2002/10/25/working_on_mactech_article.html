I’m working on part two of my MacTech article on writing contextual menu plugins. Part two will cover running Unix commands, adding a submenu to the contextual menu, handling a text selection, and sending an update event to the Finder.</p>

<p>For those who read part one—any feature requests for part two? Any questions I can answer?</p>

<p>I’m also thinking about other articles I can write for MacTech. I have lots of ideas. But I’d be happy to take suggestions. Any articles you really want to see?
