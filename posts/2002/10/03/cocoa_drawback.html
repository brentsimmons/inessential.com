I totally dig Cocoa—you’ve probably guessed that by now.</p>

<p>But there are some times when it can be infuriating. If you’re using the built-in controls and customizing them just a little bit, then it’s totally cool.</p>

<p>But then there are times when no amount of customizing will do: to get what you want you have to go back to square one, you have to subclass NSView and go from there.</p>

<p>An example of that is <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/">OmniOutliner</a>. I recall reading that it’s a complete re-implementation of NSOutlineView. (Please correct me if I’m wrong.)</p>

<p>They had to do that because, if I remember right, to get things like wrapping headlines it was necessary to start over: no amount of tweaking NSOutlineView was going to do the job. (Or at least not well.)</p>

<p>Some of the upcoming features in NetNewsWire Pro are sending me down the same path. For example, I want to do a table view like <a href="http://www.kottke.org/plus/misc/images/netnewswire.gif">Jason Kottke’s mockup</a>—but, because it has table cells of varying heights, I’m having to go back to square one, do my own NSView subclass.</p>

<p>Bummer.</p>

<p>Here’s hoping that the built-in controls get more powerful and flexible in the future.</p>

<p>(Note: I’m only pretending to complain. I <em>love</em> UI programming, so it’s not really the bummer I make it sound like.)
