Speaking of the Who (which I do, below)—if I had to pick a personal favorite band from the ’60s, it wouldn’t be the Beatles or the Rolling Stones. Or the Doors, the Kinks, Jefferson Airplane, or Bob Dylan.</p>

<p>It would be the Who. All the way. Totally.</p>

<p>Not just for their great sound and the way they smashed up their guitars onstage but for their style, the band’s persona. That whole sharp mod thing. The blue collar kid in revolt who isn’t a hippie.</p>

<p>(Hippies were, then as now, the privileged kids revolting against privilege. How totally boring. The most conventional way of being unconventional.)</p>

<p>The Who: Vespa scooters. Speed. Cool clothes.</p>

<p>Noise.</p>

<p>Love it.
