We’ve been lucky so far, we rock-n-roll fans. Every decade or so there’s a revolution, a new band (or family of bands) that comes along and changes everything.</p>

<p>From the Beatles and the Who to the Sex Pistols and the Clash to Nirvana—the history of rock is the history of rock’s revolution against itself.</p>

<p>When the Clash came along it was all Foreigner and REO Speedwagon. When Nirvana came along it was Michael Jackson and those prettified hair bands on MTV.</p>

<p>These days we have Britney Spears and boy bands and Eminem.</p>

<p>People my age, we did the Nirvana thing. It’s time for the next bunch of kids to do their thing. I have no doubt that it’s coming. </p>

<p>I just hope it’s really, really noisy. I’ll know you’re doing the right thing if my first instinct as an older person is to hate it.</p>

<p>By the way, I actually saw Nirvana perform live several times, at dorm parties and at house parties in Olympia in the late ’80s. And I couldn’t stand them. They weren’t really Nirvana yet—they were a boring heavy metal band. But, you know, they got really good later.
