For a while it seemed like the Internet was drowning in a tide of annoying crap.</p>

<p>Spam! Pop-under ads! Flash ads!</p>

<p>The day-to-day experience of working and living in this wonderful network was getting worse by the day.</p>

<p>So I took steps.</p>

<p>1. I switched from Eudora to Apple’s Mail app.</p>

<p>I did this reluctantly, and there are still some things I’d love to change about Mail, but I did it for one reason: Mail has intelligent spam filtering.</p>

<p>It lives up to its billing. It <em>is</em> all that.</p>

<p>On a bad day I see two spams. On a good day, none. Wow.</p>

<p>And I don’t have to manage a bunch of filters. (I had, no kidding, hundreds of spam filters in Eudora and I added more every day. And I was <em>still</em> drowning in spam.)</p>

<p>2. I switched from Internet Explorer to Chimera.</p>

<p>The first time a pop-under ad tried to appear, Chimera presented a dialog telling me that it could prevent pop-under ads from ever appearing. Did I want to let it do this for me?</p>

<p>Yes!</p>

<p>No more pop-up or pop-under ads. None. Zero. So cool.</p>

<p>(I understand Mozilla has the same feature, by the way.)</p>

<p>3. I nuked Flash.</p>

<p>Oddly, none of the browsers on my machine gave me the option to turn off Flash.</p>

<p>So I found where it lived on disk and I trashed it.</p>

<p>I had discovered that the major use of Flash on the Web was for <em>ads</em>. Really annoying ads, with things that move and make noise. Super-yuck.</p>

<p>Have I missed Flash? Are there other uses for Flash I’m sad about missing out on?</p>

<p>Nope. I don’t miss Flash in the least tiny bit.
