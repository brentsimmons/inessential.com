Duncan Wilcox continues the discussion on <a href="http://duncan.focuseek.com/2002/10/developforthemac/">why develop for Macs</a> instead of Windows.</p>

<p>Duncan writes: “On Windows you have 20 times as many users, but you probably have at least 5-10 times as many competitors. And for some reason, many Windows users appear to put up with the mostly crappy GUIs of free software, so you also have to compete against $0. Plus you have the Borg of all competitors.”
