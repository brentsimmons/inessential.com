Today my hope is to release a new beta of the BigCat plugin. Changes will include cool new icons and the ability to run shell scripts as well as AppleScript scripts.</p>

<p>Also there will be an installer, since people sometimes run into difficulties doing manual installs.</p>

<p>If it doesnâ€™t happen today it will probably get released tomorrow.
