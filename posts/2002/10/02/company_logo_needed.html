Company logo needed...</p>

<p>Check out the design of this site, with the big blue moon in the upper left corner. (People reading via RSS: click <a href="http://inessential.com/">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Now check out <a href="http://ranchero.com/">ranchero.com</a>.</p>

<p>The graphic in the upper-left corner there is just a place-holder. I need a company logo graphic to go in that space, something that looks at least as cool as the blue moon on inessential.com.</p>

<p>There are two options: a horseshoe or an atom. (These are the motifs Ranchero Software has traditionally used.)</p>

<p>This is the atom we used to use:</p>

<p><img src="http://inessential.com/images/atom.gif" alt="atom"  /></p>

<p>Here’s the horseshoe we used to use:</p>

<p><img src="http://ranchero.com/images/tinyshoe.gif" alt="horseshoe"  /></p>

<p>The problem with that horseshoe is that it’s too small and it’s oriented incorrectly—it should be upside down (so as to catch good luck, as the superstition goes).</p>

<p>If you’re a graphics guy, and would like to take up this challenge, I can offer no money—but I can offer a link on the right side of the ranchero.com home page and the sincere thanks of a grateful developer.</p>

<p>Also note: I’m not wedded to the current color scheme used at ranchero.com. Something brighter would probably be better.
