<a href="http://markbernstein.org/Oct0201.html#note_22825">Mark Bernstein</a>: “Tinderbox’s default behavior is pretty good, but NetNewsWire has just added some new XML drag flavors that let Tinderbox understand whether you’re dragging a news feed (which you’d probably want to have updated automatically) or a news story (where you probably want to keep the summary in Tinderbox, and to provide easy access to the full story).”</p>

<p>I’m so pleased! Thanks go to Mark and the <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox folks</a>.
