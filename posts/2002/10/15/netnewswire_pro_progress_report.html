I get a fair amount of email asking me how NetNewsWire Pro is coming along. I’ve been pretty quiet here lately because I’m very heads-down, working as fast as I can, working on the various <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/profeatures.php">new features</a>.</p>

<p>I started with the hard stuff first, some new UI programming. In various states of done-ness are weblog editing, AppleScript support, the notepad, and train-friendliness.</p>

<p>My hope is to get a beta out before the end of this month and ship it in November. (Of course, my hopes and reality may not match exactly.)</p>

<p>I get lots of requests for a Windows version, too. (Even from my <em>Mom</em> the other day.) I have a choice—keep making the Mac version better, or spend n months doing a Windows version.</p>

<p>Well, it’s a no-brainer—I’ll keep making the Mac version better. (And do some other Mac software.)
