I was thinking of starting an informal thing, not a users group or anything, but semi-regular dinners with other people here in the Northwest who are OS X developers.</p>

<p>I mean “developers” in the broad sense—not just people writing desktop apps but webloggers, scripters, designers, writers, system admins, power users, and so on.</p>

<p>OS X users who create things, in other words. Not just super-geeks.</p>

<p>There wouldn’t be a membership roll or dues or anything, just an announcement now and again to be at some restaurant at some particular time.</p>

<p>If you live in the Northwest, what do you think? Good idea? Would you attend? Me, I think it would be fun.
