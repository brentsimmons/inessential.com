I <em>love</em> deleting code.</p>

<p>Select, delete. Bam. You are the weakest method, goodbye. Build. Errors. Fix errors. Re-factor. Select, delete. Au ’voir.</p>

<p>If you work like I do, then your projects always get to a point where the main features are all there and all that’s left are bugs—and clean-up.</p>

<p>Look, there’s some lovely filth right here. Select, delete, auf wiedersehen.</p>

<p>Uh oh, looks like my data and UI are intermingled right here. Think MVC. MVC MVC. Re-factor. Select, delete. Build. Yahoo.</p>

<p>This is my favorite part of software development, when the code goes from weird but working to clean and maintainable and working much better.</p>

<p>And the most fun part is that delightful Delete key.
