Ever since I was a boy I had the idea that one day there would be the news that changes everything.</p>

<p>It could happen any day. You might wake up one day, turn on the news, and there it is, the biggest story of all time.</p>

<p>This news could be one of a few things:</p>

<p>Communication with aliens<br />
Undeniable proof of the existence or non-existence of God<br />
Demonstrable e.s.p or telekinesis or similar<br />
The invention of a time machine<br />
Travel to and from parallel universes<br />
The invention of a faster-than-light spaceship<br />
Discovery of a super-cheap, super-abundant, safe, environmentally-friendly energy source</p>

<p>Iâ€™m still waiting. Any day now.
