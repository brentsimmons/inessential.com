I’ve been thinking of starting a mailing list for developers who write web services desktop apps for Mac OS X. If I hear from a few people that they would participate, I’ll get it started.</p>

<p>It would have two main purposes:</p>

<p>1. Setting standards.</p>

<p>For instance, <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/">Steve Ivy</a> and I worked up a clipboard format for RSS items. We haven’t presented it to the world yet: I’d like to run it by a small group of developers first.</p>

<p>Such a clipboard format would allow an application like <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/macnewswire/">MacNewsWire</a>, an RSS news reader, to exchange data with a website authoring tool such as <a href="http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/faq">Archipelago</a>. In other words, one would copy (or drag) an item from MacNewsWire into Archipelago in order to post it to a weblog.</p>

<p>The point is to make sure our apps interoperate, which helps everybody.</p>

<p>2. Developing a standard toolbox of code.</p>

<p>It’s in everybody’s best interest that apps in this space are of high quality: that helps build the market. For example, Dan Wood’s excellent <a href="http://curlhandle.sourceforge.net/">CURLHandle</a> has apparently become a widely-used framework for doing HTTP downloads. I use it myself. (Dan is the guy behind <a href="http://www.karelia.com/watson/">Watson</a>.)</p>

<p>Me, I have some RSS and OPML parsing code to contribute. I bet other people have other code. Developing and testing such code, and making it available under a license (such as BSD or MIT) that allows people to use it, means we all have more time to concentrate on our respective visions rather than the nuts-and-bolts underneath.
