Help! I’m having a very hard time coming up with a cool application icon for an app I’m working on.</p>

<p>This app—a Cocoa app—will be free, and I think there’s a pretty good chance it will get on lots of desktops.</p>

<p>If you’d like to create an app icon, send me email and I’ll tell you a bit more about the app confidentially.</p>

<p>I can’t offer much—except the sincere thanks of a grateful Cocoa developer and, of course, credit in the About box, help pages, and on the website. (Your name plus a link to a URL of your choice.)
