There’s lots of free code out there—lots of code that you can learn from or contribute to or adapt for your own apps. It’s totally cool. I myself have even <a href="http://ranchero.com/opensource/">released some</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m thick, but what I can’t find is open source <em>icons</em>. These days OS X apps are supposed to have toolbars when appropriate—but there’s no source of standard and freely usable icons for commands like cut, copy, paste, refresh, view in browser, and so on.</p>

<p>Not every small developer has an art department or can afford to hire someone to do icons.</p>

<p>I propose, to all the icon makers out there, a website for open source icons. Any Mac developer could use the icons in their software as long as they give credit (with a URL) to the person who made the icons.</p>

<p>I’d be happy to do the site programming. I’d be happy to host it. I just need to hear from some actual icon designers that would like to participate. Whaddaya say?</p>

It’s just that I can verify and test Mac icons far more easily. But it would be cool to have Windows and Linux icons too.
