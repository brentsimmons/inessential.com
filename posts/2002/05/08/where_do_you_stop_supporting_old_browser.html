I agree with Brent Ashley on <a href="http://brentashley.blogchat.com/archives/000361.html#000361">not supporting older browsers</a>, particularly Netscape 4.x.</p>

<p>I propose a new rule: if you’re using standard-compliant HTML, and it doesn’t work with a given browser released last century, then you don’t have to care—unless the person paying you tells you you have to care.
