Addendum to the below on supporting older browsers—this site looks good in Lynx. It works, it’s readable, it’s usable.</p>

<p>It’s not that Lynx is so important. It barely registers on my <a href="http://inessential.com/stats/useragents.php">user-agents</a> page. But it <em>is</em> an indicator.</p>

<p>There’s an A-B-A structure going on here. The earliest websites—before tables and font tags and all that complicated stuff—worked well in Lynx. The HTML was simple and structural.</p>

<p>Then we got all that complicated stuff, and websites started looking like hell in Lynx. (Many still do.)</p>

<p>And now we’re returning to simple HTML, not unlike the HTML of 1994. More structural markup, less of that complex and weird junk. Layout is done through style sheets.</p>

<p>Sites designed that way look good in Lynx. You don’t even have to try. I didn’t go out of my way to make this site work in Lynx.</p>

<p>I’ve even thought about adding a best-viewed-with-Lynx button. But Lynx users wouldn’t be able to see it.
