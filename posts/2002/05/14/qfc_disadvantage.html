For years Sheila and I have been regular customers of <a href="http://www.qfconline.com/">QFC</a>, a regional grocery store chain.</p>

<p>Last week they lost our business.</p>

<p>We made our weekly trip to the store and discovered they had a new thing, the Advantage Card. You need to have one in order to get sale prices.</p>

<p>If you don’t have one then you pay full price.</p>

<p>And of course if you have a card then QFC can track all your purchases.</p>

<p>So what’s the advantage? It should be called the <em>Disadvantage</em> Card.</p>

<p>I’m sure QFC thinks it’s an advantage to them—but I have to think that losing good customers is not really advantageous.</p>

<p>Aside from the sheer fact of this stupid card and the privacy issues is the highly insulting marketing. They market it as if it’s something new and cool that I should really, really want. As if I’m too stupid to see what’s really going on here.</p>

<p>Well, it’s not something I want. I liked the previous system, where things that were on sale were on sale for everyone, and they didn’t know me from Adam, and they couldn’t track what I buy.</p>

<p>So we’re going to another grocery store now.<p>
