If you could read minds, would language matter? In other words, could a Spanish person who reads minds read the mind of a Russian?</p>

<p>What I mean is, I wonder if our thoughts are made of the language we speak, or if there’s a universal brain-language we all use. Or maybe there’s a brain language but it’s individual. I can’t seem to catch any one thought long enough to look at it; it turns into language when I look at it.
