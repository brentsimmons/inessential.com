Remember last week’s release of WeblogWatcher? It’s a desktop interface for Weblogs.com.</p>

<p>As just a straight mirror of the content on Weblogs.com it wasn’t very useful—but now I’ve added filters. Weblogs which match one or more filters are not shown in the main window.</p>

<p>I’ve also changed the name to Blogoscope. You can <a href="http://ranchero.com/downloads/Blogoscope1.0b2.sit">download</a> it.</p>

<p>Here’s the filters window. (Choose Preferences... from the Blogoscope menu.)</p>

<p>You can see that I’m using filters to not show Radio categories websites. (Radio’s categories feature is very cool, it’s just that I find their being listed on Weblogs.com redundant.)</p>

<p>Here’s the Blogoscope main window:</p>

<p>The beta is free. The final version will be free. The source will be released under the open source BSD license once it’s a bit further along.</p>

<p>More features to come. (And an application icon.) Feedback, bug reports, and feature requests are welcome. There are no known stability issues at this time.
