I’ve been flying blind with my websites—I had referers and user-agents stats pages, but no stats page showing which pages are most popular. So yesterday I set that up. Here for instance is the <a href="http://ranchero.com/stats/hotpages.php">hot pages</a> page for ranchero.com.</p>

<p>It’s interesting that RSS feeds occupy the top two positions.
