When I was a boy there was tremendous pressure <em>not</em> to succeed in school.</p>

<p>No, that’s not quite right. Success was good—good grades were prized—as long as you didn’t <em>try</em> to get good grades by working hard and being smart.</p>

<p>The A-list kids—the charming boys, the pretty girls, from the nicer homes—they were always on the honor roll, and they got there by habitually and openly cheating.</p>

<p>They got their homework and their test answers, often right under the teacher’s nose, from the few eggheads in class. I was one of those. I wanted to be liked, so I gave them the answers.</p>

<p>Until I realized that I would never be liked more than someone likes their prize dog.</p>

<p>And I realized it was a terrible system. The teachers wanted to be liked by these kids just as much as I did. Nobody ever got in trouble for cheating, or at least none of these kids did.</p>

<p>I quit helping them in the sixth grade, but I noticed these same kids kept on cheating all the way through high school. With no consequences. They got into good schools.</p>

<p>I don’t know what happened to them in college, since I moved across the country, but I bet they did well.</p>

<p>I hope this system has changed by now. I hope it was just the schools I went to where this was going on. But I have doubts.</p>

<p>To this day I have to work hard to remember that I don’t need to throttle back. No one’s going to make fun of me for being an egghead. Or, if they are, then screw them, I don’t care about them.</p>

<p>I wonder how many other smart people throttle back, keep their smarts in semi-seclusion, as a left-over habit from childhood. It’s a bad habit. You just have to keep reminding yourself you’re not a kid anymore.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I’ve also known eggheads who use their smarts to intimidate and belittle other people. I think it comes from the same place; it’s the defense mechanism of a snarling dog. Well, that’s not cool. Snobbery is the sickness.
