Thursday bonus beta app: <a href="http://ranchero.com/downloads/WeblogWatcher1.0b1.sit">WeblogWatcher</a>.</p>

<p>There aren’t any crashing bugs I know of, but there are some more features I want to implement—filters and favorites, sorting, Help book, etc. It’s so totally beta it doesn’t even have a web page yet.</p>

<p>It reads the changes XML file from <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/">Weblogs.com</a>, so you can see which weblogs have updated recently.</p>

<p>It needs an app icon—if anyone feels inspired to make one, that would be totally cool. I’ll give you credit in the About box and on the web page (when there is one).</p>

<p>WeblogWatcher is and will be free. I’ll release the code under the open source BSD license once it’s a little further along.</p>
