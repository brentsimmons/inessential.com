Radio UserLand is perhaps the best well-known of desktop website apps—but it’s not the only such app. The other day I checked out Geodesic’s <a href="http://www.geodesic.com/solutions/products_gc_overview.html">Great Circle</a>.</p>

<p>Though like <a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio</a> it’s a desktop website app, the similarity ends there. Great Circle is a developer’s tool for finding memory leaks and over-writes in their code.</p>

<p>You can get a good feel for the product, which runs on Linux, Windows, and various other Unices (but not OS X), by checking out the <a href="http://www.geodesic.com/solutions/products_gc_demo.html">online demo</a>.
