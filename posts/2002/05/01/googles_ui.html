You know what, as much as I love Google for their cool, clean UI—and I do—there is one little thing that bugs me.</p>

<p>You know how in the search results the URL appears in green at the bottom of each item? Well, even after all this time of using Google, I still click on the URL. And of course it’s not a link. It seems like it should be.
