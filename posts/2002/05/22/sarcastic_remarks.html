Idea for a website: SarcasticRemarks.com. Every time you refresh the home page it would display a different sarcastic remark, as in: “Thanks for your on-topic and concise feedback. It really helped me turn the corner on this project.” And: “I’m in such awe of our president’s gargantuan intellect.” And: “Oh yeah, you’re the coolest. I totally get off on your website.”</p>

<p>Of course readers should have a way of submitting new sarcastic remarks, which the editor could then approve (or not) for appearing on the home page.
