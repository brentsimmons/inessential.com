Idea for an app: The Hidden World of Unix. (A shorter name would be good, of course.)</p>

<p>It would be an exploration and learning tool. A browser like the Finder’s column view. The root objects would be directories—such as /bin, /usr/bin, and /usr/sbin—where lots of Unix tools live.</p>

<p>When you click on a tool then in the right-most column is displayed the results of whatis and the man page for that tool.</p>

<p>The idea is it would be a way for people to explore and learn about the various command-line tools installed on their system.</p>

<p>It’s unlikely I’ll do this, so if anyone else wants to—go for it.
