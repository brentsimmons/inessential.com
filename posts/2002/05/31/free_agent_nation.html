I recently read the book Free Agent Nation (which has a <a href="http://www.freeagentnation.com/">website</a>). It’s about people like me: free agents, consultants, writers, independent developers, home office folks.</p>

<p>If you’re a free agent or thinking about becoming one I recommend this book to you. It was fun to read—inspiring, even. And it opened my eyes to the shape and implications of the free agency trend.
