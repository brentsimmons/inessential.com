Why did we send Rumsfeld instead of Powell to Pakistan and India? Rumsfeld is not a diplomat. Powell is. Itâ€™s like sending Worf instead of Picard.</p>

<p>My theory: Rumsfeld is letting those guys know that if they prepare their nuclear missiles for launch the U.S. military will take those missiles out.
