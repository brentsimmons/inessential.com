Wired News: <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,56238,00.html">Monorail on City’s One-Track Mind</a>. “A single-track electric train running above cars and pedestrians’ heads has been a part of Seattle’s self-image since the early 1960s, when a one-mile stretch of last century’s transit-system-of-the-future was erected for the World’s Fair. Still, the promise of a citywide monorail system had been a dream deferred, until Tuesday’s election.”</p>

<p>The new monorail will have a stop a couple blocks from my house. I voted for it.
