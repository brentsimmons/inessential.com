<a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/beta.php">NetNewsWire Lite 1.0.2b5</a> fixes a few bugs: links in the HTML view are displayed on mouse-over, old-but-still-current items are no longer marked as unread. See the <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/changenotes.php">change notes</a> for more details.</p>

<p>(Note about the old-but-still-current items bug: it will take a few days to take effect once you start using this beta, since some stale data will have to work its way out of NetNewsWireâ€™s history database.)
