This <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/notepad.jpg">screen shot</a> of NetNewsWire Pro’s Notepad should be fairly self-explanatory.</p>

<p>As an homage to Frontier, the keyboard shortcut for opening the notepad is Cmd-Y.</p>

<p>It’s not a document-based outliner—there’s just one outliner window, and its file is stored on disk in one’s Application Support/NetNewsWire/ folder. It gets saved automatically when you make a change.</p>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, it’s an OPML file.</p>

<p>And yes, one can expect the toolbar icons and other cosmetic issues to improve between now and the first beta.
