<a href="http://ican.editthispage.com/2002/11/07">Jeff Cheney</a> remembered something that <a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/">Sheila</a> and I forgot—that Sheila’s and my weblogs just turned three years old.</p>

<p>Both of our weblogs were created shortly before Manila shipped. (For those who are new to this weblog—I used to work for UserLand, and I worked on Manila.)</p>

<p>Sheila’s weblog started as a test site. Manila was fairly close to being finished, but we wanted some more usability testing, so I asked Sheila to help, and she did.</p>

<p>Some of the more user-friendly touches came out of watching Sheila work with her site and later discussing Manila with her. I don’t remember all the details—except for one.</p>

<p>At that time, when you uploaded a picture to a Manila site, it automatically generated a shortcut name, something like picNum123, where the 123 part was the discussion group message number containing the picture.</p>

<p>This proved to be confusing and not particularly user-friendly. Sheila insisted that the shortcut should be the name of the file, as in myCat.gif or ThanksgivingTurkey.jpg.</p>

<p>So, we (UserLand) discussed it internally, and made that change before shipping—and I’m sure glad we did.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is just to say that it takes a village to raise an application. And every user of any app should remember that it’s not just the developers who deserve thanks but also the beta testers and early users.
