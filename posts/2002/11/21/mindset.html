How do 18-year-olds see the world? Beloit College’s <a href="http://www.beloit.edu/~pubaff/releases/mindset_2006.html">Class of 2006 Mindset List</a> tells us.</p>

<p>Some gems:</p>

<p>“‘Big Brother’ is merely a television show.”</p>

<p>“George Foreman has always been a barbecue grill salesman.”</p>

<p>“A ‘Hair Band’ is some sort of fashion accessory.”</p>
