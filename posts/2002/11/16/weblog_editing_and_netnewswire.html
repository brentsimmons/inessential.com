I’ve got the basics of weblog editing in NetNewsWire pro working—I’ve been using a <a href="http://brent.phrasewise.com/">Manila site</a> initially, since Manila supports both the Blogger and MetaWeblog APIs.</p>

<p>(Thanks to <a href="http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/">Daniel Berlinger</a> for setting up the site for me.)</p>

<p>Soon I’ll be setting up test sites with Radio, MovableType, and Blogger, so I can test with the main weblog tools.</p>

<p>I’d like to be able to talk to Blapp too, for posting to Blosxom sites. And also find a way to post to wikis. But one thing at a time—XML-RPC-enabled sites come first.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to getting acquainted (or re-acquainted) with the various states of the art in weblog publishers.</p>

<p>Another thing this means is that I now have calling methods via XML-RPC working pretty nicely. This opens up a <em>huge</em> world.
