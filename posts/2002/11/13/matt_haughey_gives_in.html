<a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/archived.blah/11/01/2002#1049">Matt Haughey</a>: “I don’t keep track of post titles, I don’t think the syndication file is all that useful without HTML, and I’ve never personally found much use for a RSS reader. That all changed when a friend said she wasn’t reading my site anymore, or any sites for that matter that didn’t carry RSS feeds.”</p>

<p>Brent’s Law of Weblogs: If you’re not syndicating, you’re not publishing.</p>

<p>This law is <em>descriptive</em>, not <em>prescriptive</em>.</p>

<p>RSS, or something like it, was inevitable. I used to read a couple dozen sites regularly—now I read about a hundred sites. Far more than I could ever follow in my browser. And I do actually visit the sites I subscribe to: when there’s something interesting in their feed, and it links back to the site, I go to the site.</p>

<p>Traffic patterns are changing, definitely. But RSS is a chance for webloggers to reach an even wider audience. It doesn’t mean that the HTML version of one’s site is now irrelevant—in fact, <em>because</em> of RSS and newsreaders I now visit lots of sites I never used to visit.
