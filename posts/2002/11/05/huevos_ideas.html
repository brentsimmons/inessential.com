I get a fair amount of email about how Huevos should allow one to choose a search engine from the keyboard. I agree completely.</p>

<p>Most of the email I get suggests adopting the same UI that is used in at least one <a href="http://notesbydave.com/toolbar/doc.htm">Windows app</a>—type a leading character or two to choose the search engine.</p>

<p>But I don’t like that. It’s not Mac-like.</p>

<p>What I’m thinking right now is that it would be best to allow the user to assign command keys to the various search engines. Google, for instance, might be cmd-G. You’d assign command keys through the Prefs window, the same place you edit your search engines.</p>

<p>So to run a search you’d bring Huevos to the front via a hotkey, type a command key to select your search engine, type your search string, then hit return to run the search. You’d never have to touch the mouse.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>Another Huevos idea—Huevos could be a Services provider. A Huevos submenu in the Services menu would allow you to run a search on the selected text in a given search engine. The submenu would be the list of search engines—so you’d select some text, choose Services->Huevos->Search with Google (for instance), and the search would run.
