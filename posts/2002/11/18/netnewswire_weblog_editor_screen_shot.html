Here’s a <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/weblogEditord1.jpg">screen shot of the weblog editor</a> that’s going into the pro version of NetNewsWire.</p>

<p>There’s a good chance that it will change quite a bit between now and when it actually ships, of course.</p>

<p>You can see that some of the features are in place—including editing recent items. (Note the drawer on the right side of the screen shot.)</p>

<p>There are buttons for making text bold and italic and for adding a link. A Preview button shows a preview of the item (in a sheet).</p>

<p>Though you can’t see it in this screen shot, it supports the Blogger API as well as the MetaWeblog API.</p>

<p>One of the notable missing features at the moment is categories—but they’ll be there.
