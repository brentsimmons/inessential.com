Here’s a <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/dates.jpg">screen shot of dates in NetNewsWire Pro</a>.</p>

<p>I’m still working on formatting issues—it will be contextual, as in most email apps. It will also convert to the local time zone.</p>

<p>It supports both pubDates and Dublin Core dates.</p>

<p>In looking at my subscriptions, it appears that not that many RSS feeds include dates yet. I hope that changes, because, well, knowing the date and time of an item is pretty useful.</p>

<p>Feeds for my sites don’t contain dates, even. But I’ll add dates.
