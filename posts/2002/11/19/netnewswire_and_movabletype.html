I’ve been testing NetNewsWire‘s weblog editor with MovableType—and it’s working. Here’s my <a href="http://playbacktime.com/ranchero/">test site</a>.</p>

<p>One of the painful parts of weblog editors is configuration, as Daniel Berlinger points out in his <a href="http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/discuss/msgReader$1330?mode=topic">RFC on discoverability</a>.</p>

<p>I had to send an XML-RPC request to get the blogID of my MovableType site. For Manila the URL of the site works as the blogID. I don’t know what I’ll find when I try other weblog publishing systems, but I wouldn’t be surprised to find them all slightly different.</p>

<p>This needs to get <em>much</em> easier.</p>

<p>Ideally all it would take to configure one’s editor is to know the URL of the home page of your site. (And of course you’d know your username and password also.) A user should <em>never</em> have to know or figure out the blogID, RPC URL, and supported API or APIs.
