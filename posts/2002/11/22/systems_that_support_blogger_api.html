For NetNewsWire I&#8217;m working on a list of weblog publishing systems that support the Blogger API and optionally the MetaWeblog API.</p>

<p>So far I have, in alphabetical order, Blogger, Conversant, Drupal, Manila (news items), Movable Type, pMachine, and Radio UserLand.</p>

<p>Am I missing any?</p>

<p>The way it works in NetNewsWire: when you set the prefs for a weblog, you specify the publishing system. There&#8217;s a popup menu. This way NetNewsWire knows which API or APIs are supported.</p>

<p>But you can also choose Other as the publishing system and set the supported APIs manually. (Which I do for this site and for ranchero.com.)
