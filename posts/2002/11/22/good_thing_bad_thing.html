The great thing about rolling your own weblog software is you get to do it yourself.</p>

<p>The bad thing about rolling your own weblog software is you <em>have</em> to do it yourself.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on NetNewsWire’s weblog editor—but, I confess, my weblogs don’t support either the Blogger or MetaWeblog API. So, ironically, I can’t use my weblog editor with my own weblogs.</p>

<p>So now it’s time to implement at least the relevant parts of those two APIs for my own sites, so I can edit them with NetNewsWire.</p>

<p>The thing is, the thing that makes me a geek, is that I’m looking forward to doing this bit of programming.
