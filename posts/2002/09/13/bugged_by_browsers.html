Some days I’m just totally bugged by the situation with browsers.</p>

<p>OmniWeb has way too many problems with CSS.</p>

<p>Mozilla, though wonderful in so many ways, drives like a tank—and I keep reading tales of how it eats its bookmark file. A little scary.</p>

<p>MSIE doesn’t let me block pop-up ads or block images from specific servers.</p>

<p>Chimera won’t let me set my font preferences, which I’m rather picky about.</p>

<p>I think that eventually Chimera will be my main browser, but for now, ugh, I’m screwed.
