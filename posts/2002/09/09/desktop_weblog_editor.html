Over the years I’ve grown tired of editing my weblogs in a browser. The browser interface is just too slow and too poor.</p>

<p>So today I got working a <em>very</em> early prototype of the weblog editor that will be in NetNewsWire Pro. It will support the Blogger and MetaWeblog APIs, so it will be possible to post to Radio and Blogger and MovableType etc. sites.</p>

<p>NetNewsWire Pro won’t itself create your weblog—but it will connect to whatever weblog software you use.</p>

<p>Here’s a <a href="http://inessential.com/images/weblogEditorPrototype.jpg">screen shot</a>.</p>

<p>The version that will appear in NetNewsWire probably won’t look much like the screen shot. The user interface is very much a work-in-progress.
