Here are some of the things I’ll be doing over the next several days:</p>

<p>1. A new beta of TigerLaunch.</p>

<p>2. Huevos 1.1b1—it will have a smaller window, and you’ll be able to specify whether or not it should be a floating window.</p>

<p>3. A new beta of the Big Cat contextual menu plugin. I don’t know if I’ll get all the planned features in the next beta, but planned features include running all OSA scripts, running AppleScript scripts where the script is stored in the data fork, and running shell scripts. And of course bug fixes are very important too.</p>

<p>4. The ability to subscribe to weblog comments here and on ranchero.com. (It will be a members-only feature in order to prevent abuse.)</p>

<p>5. A search engine for this site and for ranchero.com.</p>

<p>6. A re-design of this site.
