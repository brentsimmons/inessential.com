At a suggestion from <a href="http://scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a>, instead of adding email subscriptions for comments pages, I added RSS subscriptions.</p>

<p>On every comments page (on this site and on ranchero.com), near the bottom of each page, there’s a link to an RSS feed for just that page. That way you can keep up with any conversations you may be interested in.</p>

<p>I might also add email subscriptions, too—but I think RSS solves the problem very nicely.
