<a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/beta.php">NetNewsWire Lite 1.0.1b1</a> has been posted. (I created a new page for betas, so the main page can always point to the current release version.)</p>

<p>The important change in this version is that the clipboard formats for RSS sources and RSS items have been cleaned up and <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/rssclipboard.php">documented</a>. Sample code is provided for both Carbon and Cocoa.</p>

<p>The idea is so that other apps can work with NetNewsWire via copy-and-paste and drag-and-drop.</p>

<p>Of course, this isn’t the final step in getting apps to work together, but it’s an important step.
