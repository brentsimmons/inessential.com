It’s almost like a religion with me—apps should work together. No app is an island.</p>

<p>This is one of the things that got me into scripting (and later into working for <a href="http://www.userland.com/">UserLand Software</a>).</p>

<p>And it’s one of the reasons I like OS X. It blends two worlds, Mac Apple events scripting and Unix scripting.</p>

<p>The bare bones level of working together for GUI apps is the clipboard. Can you copy from one app to another? Can you drag from one app to another?</p>

<p>Later today or tonight, if all goes according to plan, I’ll release a new beta of NetNewsWire Lite with cleaned-up and documented clipboard formats.</p>

<p>The idea being that you could drag an RSS subscription to <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a>, for instance. Or copy an RSS item into <a href="http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/faq">Archipelago</a> or <a href="http://disco.ucsd.edu/blog/computers/apps/Blapp">Blapp</a>. And so on.</p>

<p>So, along with a new beta of NetNewsWire Lite, I’ll also put up a page that documents the clipboard formats for RSS items and RSS subscriptions that NetNewsWire exports. (When copying and when dragging it uses the same formats.)</p>

<p>Along with the documentation I’ll release sample code, a Cocoa app and a Carbon app, that show how to get the information from the clipboard.</p>

<p>Of course, it will still be up to other developers to take the sample code and integrate it with their apps. But I’ve talked with a few people via email and I think we’ll see this happen.</p>

<p>Which is totally cool.
