<a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/09/21.html#aggregator_survey">Mark Pilgrim notes</a> that NetNewsWire has taken over the #1 spot as the most-used aggregator reading his site.</p>

<p>When I read that, I laughed, because here’s the irony—on this site, on my own personal weblog, Radio UserLand rather than NetNewsWire is the most-used aggregator.</p>

<p>(Check out the <a href="http://inessential.com/stats/referers.php">referers page</a>.)</p>

<p>But you know what? It’s all good.</p>

<p>Though Radio and NetNewsWire have some overlapping functionality, the two apps can also be seen as complementary. I plan to develop this further in the pro version, which will be scriptable and will include the ability to publish to Radio weblogs.
