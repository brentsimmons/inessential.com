<a href="http://erin.clerico.com/2002/09/20.html">Erin Clerico</a>: “I got a little cranky with someone who I felt was encroaching on the Weblogger name and I made some reckless threats about legal action as a remedy. I have and do admit that I was wrong...”</p>

<p>This site and ranchero.com are both hosted by Erin’s company <a href="http://www.weblogger.com/">Weblogger.com</a>. </p>

<p>It’s an absolute pleasure having Weblogger.com as my host. Erin provides great service when I need help.</p>

<p>My sites stay up and stay fast. No funny business.</p>

<p>Do I recommend Weblogger.com to folks looking for a host? Hell yes.
