The other day, Joel Spolsky wrote about the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020910.html">economics of developing for Macintosh</a>.</p>

<p>I don’t think Joel is wrong about anything he says. It’s true, for instance, that  “if your Windows product appeals to 1 in 100 Windows users, you have to appeal to 25 in 100 Mac users to make the same amount of money.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, it’s still true that if Joel sells 10,000 copies to <em>Windows</em> users of a $100 app, he makes the same amount of money as I do if I sell 10,000 copies to <em>Mac</em> users of a $100 app.</p>

<p>But whatever.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I develop for OS X is that, when it comes to user interface, this is the big leagues, this is <em>the show</em>. That’s probably what Joel would call an “emotional appeal”—and to call it that, that’s fine by me.</p>

<p>To switch metaphors: imagine you think you’re a good writer. You think you have the talent to write excellent novels. You also have the talent to be a really great sports journalist—you could probably get a column in some newspaper somewhere and be very comfortable, maybe even win a Pulitzer or two.</p>

<p>Which do you choose?</p>

<p>Writing novels is the bigger risk and the bigger reward, by far. I choose that (metaphorical) path. How could I not?</p>

<p>The other path is honorable and sensible and has its rewards too.</p>

<p>But to me it’s the difference between an empty night sky and a night sky with all the stars shining and a big, bright <em>bella luna</em>. “Emotional appeal?” Oh yes indeed. And I don’t apologize for that for one second.
