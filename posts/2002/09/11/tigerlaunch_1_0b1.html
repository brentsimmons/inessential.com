Here’s the deal:</p>

<p>I don’t like having lots of apps in my dock: I like to keep just the half-dozen very important apps in my dock.</p>

<p>But pretty often I have to launch a non-dock-worthy app. I don’t like having to hunt for it. Is it in the Applications folder? Is it in a sub-folder? Is it in the Developer Applications folder? Where is it?</p>

<p>So a while ago I created a little utility app that lists my apps in a flat menu, in alphabetical order by name. This way it’s super-easy to launch these non-dock-worthy apps. No hunting, no digging through folders.</p>

<p>Today I cleaned it up and released it as <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/tigerlaunch/">TigerLaunch 1.0b1</a>. It’s an open source (BSD license) Cocoa app.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t use the app, the source may be useful—it shows how to create NSStatusItems, how to add icons to a menu, and how to create a table with icons and checkboxes.</p>

<p>Here’s a screen shot of the <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/tigerlaunch/appsmenu.jpg">Apps menu</a> it provides. Here’s a screen shot of the <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/tigerlaunch/configurewindow.jpg">configure window</a>.</p>

<p>Note: the app <em>really</em> needs a new application icon. Right now it’s a picture of my cat Papa flying through the air. If you create a cool app icon for it, please email it to me (to brent at ranchero dot com). I’ll credit you in the About box and on the TigerLaunch page, including a link to your website.
