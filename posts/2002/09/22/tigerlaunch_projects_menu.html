The TigerLaunch Projects menu lists only Project Builder projects.</p>

<p>But it should also list project files from other apps.</p>

<p>So here are the questions:</p>

<p>1. What additional project file types should it list?</p>

<p>2. How does one identify these other project file types? (In other words, whatâ€™s the file name suffix for REALbasic project files? Etc.)
