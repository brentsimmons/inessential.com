<a href="http://www.guide.co.uk/">www.guide.co.uk</a>: “We spend time tracking down the really useful applications, utilities and general Mac information and provide details of them here.”</p>

<p>I found this site via my referers page. (Thanks for listing NetNewsWire!)</p>

<p>There are lots of other cool apps listed there, several of which I didn’t know about but will have to check out.
