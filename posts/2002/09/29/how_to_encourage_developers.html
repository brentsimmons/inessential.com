How do you encourage developers to do good work? <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2002/09/feed_me.html">Say nice things</a> about their software.</p>

<p>Really. It works.</p>

<p>I even get a little thrill when I read compliments of <em>other people’s</em> software. If someone writes about how much they love Radio UserLand, or Transmit, or BBEdit, or whatever—then it’s a reminder that there are cool folks out there who care about software and are nice enough to let the developers know when they do good work.
