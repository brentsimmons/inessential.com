Today I started working on a new feature for the Big Cat plugin—the ability to run shell scripts from the contextual menu.</p>

<p>A new beta is several days away, but I figured I’d mention it because, well, it’s cool.</p>

<p>By shell scripts I also mean Python, Perl, and so on. In fact, I’ve been using Python mostly so far. (Python comes with Jaguar, by the way.)</p>

<p>Oh, and not only does Python come with Jaguar, but Python’s XML-RPC library comes with Jaguar. Sweet.
