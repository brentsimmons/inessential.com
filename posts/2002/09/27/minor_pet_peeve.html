I’ve been seeing more and more that sites put up a list of newsreaders and aggregators when they link to their RSS feed.</p>

<p>That’s totally cool.</p>

<p>But lots of sites miss listing <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/straw/">Straw</a>, the desktop news aggregator for GNOME. Don’t forget about Straw. It’s cool.
