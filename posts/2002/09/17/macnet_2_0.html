I didn’t know about the <a href="http://www.macnet2.com/">MacNET 2.0</a> weblog until I saw it on the Ranchero <a href="http://ranchero.com/stats/referers.php">referers page</a>. Naturally it will be added to the NetNewsWire Sites Drawer in the next release. (And not just because they like NetNewsWire Lite! It’s a good site. The link to Ranchero just happens to be how I noticed it.)
