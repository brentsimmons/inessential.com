Apparently there’s a <a href="http://blog.meetup.com/?localeId=413">Seattle weblogger meetup</a> this Wednesday evening. Who’s the nut case who decided this would be on the same night as the Enterprise premiere? Don’t they know geeks at all?</p>

<p>Still, I might go. Not sure. I can always tape Enterprise. But then there’s the question of having enough energy. (I’m in ship mode for NetNewsWire Lite. Crunch time.)
