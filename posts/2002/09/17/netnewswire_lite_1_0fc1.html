<a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire Lite 1.0fc1</a> fixes bugs and adds a bunch of sites to the sites drawer.</p>

<p>Here are the <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/changenotes.php">change notes</a>.</p>

<p>The thing to do now is find deal-stopper bugs. Are there any bugs big enough that they just gotta be fixed before 1.0 ships?
