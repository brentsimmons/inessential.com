I re-designed <a href="http://ranchero.com/">ranchero.com</a>—but, the funny thing is, you might never notice. If you look at the <a href="http://ranchero.com/stats/useragents.php">user agents page</a> you’ll note that most of the hits come from RSS news readers, from Radio UserLand and AmphetaDesk and NetNewsWire Lite.
