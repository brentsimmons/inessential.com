<a href="http://bumppo.net/archives/2002/09/22.html#000123">Nat Irons</a>: “I learned that Brent Simmons is not a giant blond man. Based on zero evidence, I had always envisioned him as sort of a Nordic Paul Bunyan. It’s always jarring to meet someone in person and give up my whimsical mental pictures. However, he does have very precise diction.”</p>

<p>That reminds me of when I was a new UserLand employee. The night before I first met <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0111108/">Doug Baron</a>, <a href="http://scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a> and I were going to Buck’s for some dinner, and Dave asked me what I thought Doug looked like. I though he’d be tall and blond. After all, the name Doug is a very blond name, and the last name Baron suggests aristocracy.</p>

<p>Was I right? Nope. Wrong on both counts.
