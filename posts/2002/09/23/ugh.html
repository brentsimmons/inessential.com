A telemarketer just called me (from Evergreen/Washelli) and let me know that I’m entitled to a $200 discount on cremation or burial.</p>

<p>Holy cow!</p>

<p>I hung up, naturally.</p>

<p>I can’t say enough bad things about people who call me up to remind me of my mortality. So I won’t say anything in particular. Except that it’s bad.
