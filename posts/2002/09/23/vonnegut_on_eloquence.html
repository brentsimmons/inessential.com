Kurt Vonnegut, in an <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/2002/09/16vonnegut1.html">interview</a>: “I just don’t think people get off on language anymore. Language used to be an elevated art. It used to be for people what music can be. But people don’t learn to do that anymore, so eloquence is merely a matter of waste now. Who needs a good vocabulary and proper English?” (Via <a href="http://www.blackbeltjones.com/work/index.html">blackbeltjones</a>.)
