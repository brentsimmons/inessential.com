I got my first inquiry today about how to get one’s site listed in the default subscriptions list for NetNewsWire.</p>

<p>My current policy is to change the defaults for each release. Mainly so that I can spread the flow—there are <em>lots</em> of deserving sites.</p>

<p>But also so that no one site gets overwhelmed by additional bandwidth charges.</p>

<p>But what if someone asks to have their site listed as a default subscription?</p>

<p>As has been suggested by other people, this is probably something I should charge money for. I can’t, after all, just say Yes to everyone who asks—or else the default list would be <em>huge</em>, and I want to keep it to 15 sites.</p>

<p>I can’t think of an ethical reason not to charge money for placement in the default list. (Though of course I can reserve the right to turn down a site for any arbitrary reason.)</p>

<p>Reality check time. Is this reasonable and ethical, or is there something I haven’t thought of? What do <em>you</em> think?
