Speaking of Doug Baron (see my previous post)—I just remembered one of the funnier things to happen some years ago at a UserLand meeting.</p>

<p>During a break, Doug and <a href="http://www.biermania.com/">Bob</a> and I were talking about vacations, which led to talking about sunscreen lotion.</p>

<p>Doug explained that he used SPF <em>32</em>.</p>

<p>32?</p>

<p>We started laughing—only to a programmer would 32 be a round number (as a power of two).</p>

<p>(Perhaps you had to be there.)
