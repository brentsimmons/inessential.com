I want to set up a search engine for my websites. It appears to me that my choice is between <a href="http://www.htdig.org/">ht://Dig</a> and <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/index.html">Jakarta Lucene</a>.</p>

<p>Does anyone have good reasons to choose one over another? Or is there another option I havenâ€™t considered?
