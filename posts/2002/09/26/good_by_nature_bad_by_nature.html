It seems to me that Americans, and maybe other people, are divided on a fundamental question.</p>

<p>Are people good until corrupted by society? Or does society tame our immoral (or amoral) natures?</p>

<p>Here’s an example of what I mean:</p>

<p>Some people say that racism is learned. It’s society and her institutions that teaches people to discriminate against people who look different.</p>

<p>Other people say that racism is innate: people fear people who look different, but society teaches us not to be racists. (Imperfectly, of course.)</p>

<p>So: where are you on this question?</p>

<p>How does your viewpoint affect your actions?</p>

<p>Is one outlook inherently immoral?
