Is it just me, or has the pronunciation of English actually evolved noticeably during my lifetime?</p>

<p>It seems to me that we’re pronouncing the letter T less and less. If it’s at the beginning of a word—<em>two</em>, <em>tape</em>, <em>tip</em>—we pronounce it. But if it appears later in the word it’s pronounced less and less often, it’s swallowed—<em>right</em>, <em>eight</em>, <em>select</em>.</p>

<p>(An exception to the swallowing is compound words—<em>sometimes</em>, for example.)</p>

<p>Maybe it’s just me. And maybe it’s okay, and maybe I shouldn’t worry about it so much.
