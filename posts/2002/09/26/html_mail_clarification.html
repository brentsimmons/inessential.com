To clarify:</p>

<p>My reason for considering filtering all HTML email to the trash is not so much my distaste for the format (though that is a factor) but because, at least for the email I receive, <em>only spammers send HTML email</em>.</p>

<p>And I hate spam.</p>

<p>So I have to weigh the choice. Nuke a ton of spam with one filter, knowing that I’ll probably miss a few legitimate messages, or keep creating more specific spam filters.</p>

<p>I’m really tired of creating spam filters.
