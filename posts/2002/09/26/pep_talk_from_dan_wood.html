Watson developer Dan Wood, in an <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2002/09/26/dev_osx.html">interview with O’Reilly</a>, gives Mac developers a great pep talk: “It’s actually possible to get a new product built and selling with a minimal outlay of time and money. Of course, you need a good idea, and you have to work hard, but it is possible to make a living and build a successful software company, even in today’s economy, even deploying on a ‘minority’ operating system like the Mac, even Mac OS X only.”</p>

<p>There’s more, of course—just go read the article already.
