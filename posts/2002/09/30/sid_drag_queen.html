Steve Ivy’s weblog editor <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/spareparts/2002/09/30#item1479">Sid</a> is, as far as I know, the first weblog editor to accept dragged RSS items from NetNewsWire. Right on!</p>

<p>In case it’s not obvious, what Steve and I and many other developers are working toward is making OS X the best OS for people who read and write for the web.</p>

<p>The idea is that you’ll be able to mix-and-match software from different developers and build your own environment that works how you want it to work. A key part of this is the simple things like making sure drag-and-drop and copy-and-paste work between all these different apps.
