<p>Years ago I picked up a habit from Worf on Star Trek. Whenever some people did something sneaky or treacherous, especially if they tried to hide, Worf would say something like, <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/machoops6/kd/sounds/people/tng/worf1.wav">They are without honor</a>.</p>

<p>So that’s what I do. I’m watching TV news about the Enron scandal. Sheila and I are just speechless, flabbergasted, bewildered. Suddenly I say, affecting a deep voice and enunciating clearly, “They are cowards and they have <em>no</em> honor.”</p>
