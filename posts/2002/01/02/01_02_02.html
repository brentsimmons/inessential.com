<p>Papa’s taught himself how to play fetch. He licks my face. He follows me everywhere around the house.</p>

<p>Is he a dog in cat’s clothing?</p>

<p>I have no idea what Apple’s coming out with at MacWorld.</p>

<p>But I know what I want: a wireless web pad. A big tablet with a pen and a browser. Light weight. I carry my iBook around the house, but it’s overkill for just reading.</p>

<p>Some other ideas, off the top of my head, totally not based on anything but my own imagination:</p>

<p>1.5 Ghz Macs</p>

<p>A new pda, son of Newton</p>

<p>An Apple-branded Palm OS pda</p>

<p>iPhoto (Photoshop for the rest of us)</p>

<p>Son of iMac—LCD screen iMacs</p>

<p>G4 Sphere—like a cube but round</p>

<p>weblog tool that publishes to iDisk</p>

<p>OS X for x86</p>

<p>iMusic—music mixer, editor</p>

<p>skinnable OS X</p>

<p>Apple-branded Wacom tablet</p>

<p>HyperCard Carbon</p>

<p>Aqua/Cocoa/ProjectBuilder for Linux</p>

<p>iNews—some kind of fancy RSS news reader</p>

<p>My official prediction: none of the above.</p>
