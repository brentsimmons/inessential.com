<p>So we were all over at Bill Gates’ doing bong hits and hanging out on his giant couch and then I’m all, “Dude, why are you so pushy?”</p>

<p>He starts laughing in that weird high-pitched voice he gets when he’s like totally baked, and his eyes are red behind those wire-frames, and he goes, “Pushy? I’m pushy? A-ha-ha-ha-ha...”</p>

<p>“Totally, dude,” I go, suddenly all serious and shit. I’m all, “Dude, you are <em>so</em> pushy, Mr. Pushmeister, the pushiest dude ever. All push, no beatin’ around the bush, pushy like smooshy.”</p>

<p>He laughs. “A-ha-ha-ha-ha.” Then he sniffles and wipes his nose on his sleeve and collects himself. He goes, “Dude, I will give you a billion dollars to shut the hell up.”</p>

<p>And I’m all, “Cool by me. You go, Billy boy.”</p>

<p>So he writes me a check for a billion dollars, signs his name and all, and I shut up.</p>

<p>Then he launches into this rant about Dot Net, “It’s so great, blah blah blah I’m so brilliant, blah blah blah, next generation n tier Web Services blah blah blah...”</p>

<p>He goes on and on. I start to doze, I’m just kinda mellow now, I don’t mind his boring rap too much since my mind is just kinda wandering. But then I realize he’s talking about something else now: Canada.</p>

<p>He goes, “I could bring down Canada. Like right now, if I wanted to. Every man, woman, and child in Canada. Not that I’d ever want to, but I <em>could</em>, that’s my point. I like <em>own</em> Canada, only they don’t know it, but they’re mine. Bring ’em down, I could.”</p>

<p>Well, I’ve got a check for a billion dollars in my pocket, so I could give a rat’s ass about our neighbors to the north, but I figured somebody might want to know.</p>
