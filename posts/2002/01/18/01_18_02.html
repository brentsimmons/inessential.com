<p>Yesterday usernum 1011 <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2002/01/17.html#a976">wrote</a>: “I think that Microsoft will eventually gain the trust of consumers. After all, won’t it be cool to go to eBay and be able to buy something using your Passport? Think five years from now when there are hundreds of thousands of sites that accept Passport.”</p>

<p>My response? No goddamn way. I think consumer trust of Microsoft is eroding on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Rome fell. Napoleon lost. Empires end.</p>
