<p>It wasn’t until I got a kitten that I realized there might be a use for my giant mutant hand.</p>

<p>I downloaded and used iPhoto last night. Not really to put it through its paces, but because I needed a way to process screen shots for a story on <a href="http://radio.userland.com/macOsX">Radio UserLand and OS X</a>.</p>

<p>I’m happy to report it worked fine: it has what’s needed to put together screen shots. Which is three things:</p>

<p>1. A way to import a .tiff file (a screen shot file).</p>

<p>2. A way to crop a picture.</p>

<p>3. A way to save it as a JPEG.</p>

<p>iPhoto is very different from any other image editing app I’ve used. It doesn’t do much editing besides cropping, rotating, and making a picture black-and-white. And instead of working on a file-by-file basis, it’s more like a database of pictures.</p>

<p>I didn’t think I’d care about the database part, but now I see that it’s pretty nice. I’ll have a browseable, categorized history of screen shots. That could be useful.</p>

<p>Here’s a {pictureLink ("screen shot", "iPhotoScreenShots.jpg")} of iPhoto running on my machine with a bunch of screen shots imported.</p>

<p>(You’ll know I’ve gone looney if I order a book of screen shots.)</p>

<p>I still think a simple, low-cost image editor for OS X would be useful. Something with just the very basic features of Photoshop at a tenth the price. iPhoto is not that app. (Which is okay; it’s not meant to be.)</p>

<p>Since posting the above, some people have sent me suggestions for apps to try:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.AmbrosiaSW.com/utilities/snapzprox/">Snapz Pro</a> for doing screen shots.</p>

<p><a href="http://lemkesoft.com/us_gcabout.html">GraphicConverter</a> for editing and converting.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.componentx.com/FotoTrimmer/">Bosco’s Foto Trimmer</a> for editing.</p>
