<p>Apple’s home page says: To go where no PC has gone before.</p>

<p>And my first thought is: To the bathroom? Is it a bathroom computer?</p>

<p>I’m not sure that’s what Apple means me to think.</p>

<p>I mean, where haven’t PCs gone? What with colonoscopy and all they’ve gone pretty much everywhere.</p>

<p>A number of people asked me what yesterday’s story meant. Answer: nothing in particular, it’s just a story I hoped would be funny. For me it’s funny to imagine Bill Gates as a cranky, impulse-ridden pothead with delusions of grandeur. There’s no other meaning to decode.</p>

<p>Ken Dow sent me email pointing to the <a href="http://www.standonguard.com/index2.html">Canadian World Domination</a> website. Apparently all American hopes now rest with that great patriot Bill Gates. Only he can save us from marauding hockey players and eh-sayers.</p>

<p>I don’t smoke pot, by the way. Not out of any conviction, but due to an unfortunate quirk of body chemistry. Here’s what happens to me. I get quiet and paranoid, then I get angry and even more paranoid (but still quiet), then I go throw up, then I go to sleep. All in the space of about 30 minutes. Ugh. Who needs that? I’d rather get punched in the face.</p>

<p><strong>Epilogue</strong></p>

<p>I got a call from Bill after he read yesterday’s post. He’s all, “Dude, you don’t get it, do you.”</p>

<p>“Dude, what?” I said.</p>

<p>“You don’t know me. You don’t know the real me. So why don’t you get down off your high horse and take a bath, you stupid flapjack.”</p>

<p>He’s always like all weird like that when he’s high. I could tell he was maddeningly high, his mind had gone ker-plunk, he was running around in left field without snowshoes.</p>

<p>I go, “Dude, calm down. <em>Simmer.</em>”</p>

<p>And then there’s a long pause, and then he goes, in this real small voice, sounding like a little transistor radio picking up signals from space, “Nobody knows the real me.”</p>

<p>“Dude,” I say, “Dude, <em>listen</em>. You have an empire to keep tabs on. So lay off the weed during the day, at least, would ya?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, whatever,” he goes. Then another long pause. Then he goes, real fast, “Say hi to Sheila.” Then click. He’s hung up.
