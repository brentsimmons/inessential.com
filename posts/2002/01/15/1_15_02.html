<p>A couple more Radio tips that I’ve found useful:</p>

<p>1. If you’re running Radio on a Mac, and you have two machines, try connecting to your desktop website from another machine. That’s what I usually do—I’ve found it’s faster, even when running Radio on OS X.</p>

<p>2. In the News Aggregator prefs, on the Where to go after Post? page, check the box and click Submit. This way, after you post an item from the News page, you’ll return to the News page so you can post more items.</p>

<p>Hippo birdies two ewes to <a href="http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/2002/01/15">Daniel Berlinger</a>!  I’ve known Daniel for a bunch of years now, and you’d be hard-pressed to find a more rational, creative, and generous person anywhere.</p>
