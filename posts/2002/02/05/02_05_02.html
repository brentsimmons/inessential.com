<p>I checked out <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla0.9.8/">Mozilla 0.9.8</a> for OS X last night—and was very pleased with how it looked much more like an OS X application than did previous releases. It doesn’t seem like so much of an oddball anymore.</p>

<p>However, on my machine there’s still something jerky and slow about the interface that’s just a bit too annoying to make it my main browser. I <em>want</em> to use it, but for now I’m still using IE, which feels smoother and faster. Nuts.</p>
