<p><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001179/2002/01/31.html">Radio Wiredfool</a>: “Why buy cat toys, when they can have the cardboard box that your toys come in?”</p>

<p>I’ve often asked myself the same question. Some of Papa’s favorite toys have been pieces of tape and plastic and crumpled-up magazine subscription cards.</p>

<p>I think we buy the toys because <em>we</em> think they’re cute. Papa, he’ll just bite anything.</p>
