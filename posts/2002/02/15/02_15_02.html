<p>I was happy to see this <a href="http://www.realsoftware.com/realbasic/about/Carbon_vs_Cocoa.html">white paper</a> on the differences between Carbon and Cocoa.</p>

<p>There’s alot of religion on this topic; this paper is a nice antidote.</p>

<p>I myself like Carbon and Cocoa both. They’re both good.</p>

<p>I’ve often wondered about tech religion. I’ve often wondered about the kind of mind that can’t like two things, that has always to proclaim one is great and the other evil.</p>

<p>What’s so hard about liking two things? (Or three things or four?)</p>

<p>From where comes the need to make everyone think the same as you?</p>

<p>After spam, tech zealots are the most unpleasant thing on the Internet.</p>

<p>With as much irony as I can muster, I call zealots “the herd of independent thinkers.”</p>
