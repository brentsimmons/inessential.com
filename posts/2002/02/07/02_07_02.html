<p>If I had a time machine, where would I go? Top ten list of places.</p>

<p>1. The liberation of Paris. Does anything else compare, for pure joy? I doubt it.</p>

<p>2. The Library of Alexandria. I’d back up a bunch of moving vans and bring all the books back to the present.</p>

<p>3. Gertrude Stein’s Paris, 1900-1927. Hang out with Picasso in his studio; go drinking with Hemingway. I’d take a side trip to New York City for the Armory Show.</p>

<p>4. The American Revolution. I could spend hours and hours talking to Jefferson and Hamilton.</p>

<p>5. Athens at the time of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. (Socrates, don’t drink that! It’s poison, dude!)</p>

<p>6. Studio 54 in the pre-AIDS, pre-Just-Say-No ’70s.</p>

<p>7. New York City in the ’50s and ’60s. Hang out with the Abstract Expressionists, then move on to Andy Warhol’s Factory.</p>

<p>8. Paris at the time of Voltaire and Denis Diderot.</p>

<p>9. The Roman Empire before Christianity took hold. (Nothing against Christianity, mind you, I just want to see what the empire was like.)</p>

<p>10. Shakespeare’s England. Who wouldn’t want to see the original productions at the Globe theater?</p>

<p>People who let their dogs roam free to shit in other people’s yards <em>suck</em>.</p>

<p>Note to whoever owns those big standard poodles here in Ballard: I will find you and I will put you to sleep. And you will go to Hell.</p>

<p>I will then shoot your dogs, and they will join you in Hell. I’m not kidding.</p>

<p>I just spent half an hour shovelling shit. No jury in the world would convict me.</p>

<p>I’m more likely to get a medal for service to humanity.</p>

<p>If you, dear reader, have been letting your dogs roam free into other people’s yards, don’t kid yourself: you <em>are</em> making some people murderously mad.</p>
