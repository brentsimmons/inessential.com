<p>My boss <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/02/20#l6af76d86aa9f9a410c6992ca50009a9c">posits a false opposition</a> between CSS and Dogma 2000. “If you believe the Web is a come-as-you-are, we’re-all-just-folks writing and reading environment, why bother with CSS?”</p>

<p>My questions: why <em>not</em> bother with CSS? Or, why bother with a table-based layout?</p>

<p>In other words, Dogma 2000 suggests to me that I can work how I want to work. If I find CSS makes it easier to design and maintain my sites, then I’ll use it.</p>

<p>Yes, that means learning CSS in the first place. But, once learned, I’ve found it easier to deal with than table-based layouts.</p>

<p>It’s all about making my work easier. I like CSS for the same reasons I like Manila and Radio: separation of form and content.</p>

<p>But I’m not going to tell <em>you</em> what to do. You choose.</p>
