<p>Last night I dreamt of a beer tree. A mighty oak with cans of beer hung like Christmas ornaments from its limbs.</p>

<p>We started by picking off and drinking the low-hanging beer. As we drank more we had to climb more. People fell down laughing. It was okay.</p>

<p>Then somehow I was running house to house through people’s gardens and everything as some mean people were shooting arrows at me.</p>

<p>I escaped by throwing handfuls of diamonds in their faces.</p>

<p>Then I bought movie tickets for me and Sheila.</p>

<p>I just discovered the real reason Apple discontinued the G4 Cube.</p>

<p>With the touch-sensitive power button on top of the cube, <em>it’s not cat-proof</em>.</p>
