<p>I had thought Adobe killed GoLive’s <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/golive/overview.html">workgroup Web server</a>—but now it’s shipping as part of GoLive 6.0.</p>

<p>I just read Christopher Hitchens’ <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0465030327">Letters to a Young Contrarian</a>. I recommend it to every weblogger who strives to be skeptical and critical of received opinion.</p>

<p>I was once the victim of racial profiling at an airport.</p>

<p>It was a few years ago, an anniversary of the bombing of the Federal building in Oklahoma.</p>

<p>I was at Sea-Tac, a 30-year-old white guy in the Northwest travelling alone. Dressed in black. Short hair. Very little baggage. My tickets had been purchased only a few days before.</p>

<p>I was escorted from the check-in counter to security where my bags were searched. I was told to go to the gate and stay there until boarding.</p>

<p>I have no doubt they were only searching white guys that day.</p>

<p>If they could have searched my brain they’d have known how much I am the opposite of those psychotic teabags who blow up buildings. But I’m glad they can’t search my brain.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’m not complaining, or stating an opinion one way or the other about racial profiling, I’m just noting the irony.</p>
