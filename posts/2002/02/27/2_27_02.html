<p>Years ago Sheila and I worked in a <a href="http://www.ibs.fr/ext/labos/LPC/welcome_fr.htm">biology lab in France</a>. There was a French graduate student, a clean-cut young man and a clothes-horse, who spoke English well but imperfectly.</p>

<p>One feature of clean-cut young men is that they’re frequently shocked by things.</p>

<p>This young man missed one of the fine points of English. Whenever he was shocked, he would declare, loudly and indignantly, “I’m shocking!”</p>

<p>We never corrected him because it was so funny. He was the farthest thing from shocking, a most un-shocking young man. So to hear him stand up and declare, with Gallic indignation and a French accent, that he was shocking—well, it made us laugh like the crazy hamburger-eaters we were.</p>

<p>I’ve found that even native English speakers make a similar mistake with the word <em>nauseous</em>.</p>

<p>Whenever someone says or writes that they’re nauseous, I laugh, because it’s the same mistake my French friend made.</p>

<p>Something that’s nauseous is something that causes nausea.</p>

<p>If you’ve been affected by something that’s nauseous, then you have been <em>nauseated</em>.</p>

<p>Get it? Saying “I’m nauseous” is like saying “I’m shocking!”</p>
