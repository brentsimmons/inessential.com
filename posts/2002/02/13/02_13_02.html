<p>My boss <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/02/13#areTablesReallyEvil">asks</a> why use CSS instead of tables for layout? My response:</p>

<p>It’s nothing more or less than separating form from content.</p>

<p>It is now possible to make your HTML <em>completely</em> free of style and layout information. It can be purely structural. No font tags; no b, i, u; no tables.</p>

<p>All style and layout can be done in a style sheet.</p>

<p>It’s irresistible (for me) for the exact same reason a CMS is irresistible—it makes it much easier to maintain a site.</p>

<p>But it’s not a cause (for me). I don’t care how Joe Blow works; I care about how I work.</p>

<p>There are some additional side benefits of using CSS over tables—it’s far easier to create accessible pages, which many people must do by law or by their organization’s guidelines.</p>

<p>It also means you can do things like print-friendly pages without any server-side work—the print-friendly page is just a different style sheet, another view of the exact same page.</p>

<p>Now you might wonder why this site still uses tables. Simple: because I haven’t had time to re-do it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/atom.gif" height="30" width="29" border="0" alt="" /></p>

<p>Plus it makes your clothes brighter and your smile whiter.</p>

<p><img src="/images/atom.gif" height="30" width="29" border="0" alt="" /></p>

<p>As far as standards go, my favorite isn’t CSS but DCCP—Distributed Cold Cuts Protocol—which makes possible Web Salamis, server-side prosciutto processing, and so on.</p>
