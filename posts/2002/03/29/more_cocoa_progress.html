I was proud of myself. After another day of working through that Cocoa book I had the urge to do a simple app from scratch.</p>

<p>So I did. It just displayed one window with an input text field and a button. Type in the text field, then click the button, then the browser runs a Google search on whatever you typed.</p>

<p>It took me about <em>ten minutes</em> from start to finish.</p>

<p>Admittedly it’s not very useful, so I’m not releasing it (even as sample code). Unless, that is, that I decide to take the obvious next steps, which are... Anybody? Anybody?</p>

<p>Yes, that’s right, a pop-up menu allowing you to choose the search engine. So you could choose Google, Apple developer docs, the PHP website, Dictionary.com, etc.</p>

<p>And of course via Preferences you could add, edit, and delete search engines: it would have to be customizable. Now that would be a pretty useful app—more useful than the unfortunate Sherlock, at least.
