<a href="http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn2046.html">New Apple technote</a> “describes the AEStream* collection of APIs that can be used to construct Apple event records and Apple event descriptors using stream oriented calling conventions. These APIs allow you to use interesting and easy to maintain stream oriented algorithms for creating complex Apple event descriptor records.”
