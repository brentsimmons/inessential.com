<a href="http://www.devshed.com/Server_Side/PHP/ErrorHandling/ErrorHandling1/page1.html">Developer Shed</a>: “No developer, no matter how good he or she may be, writes error-free code all the time. Which is why most programming languages—including PHP—come with built-in capabilities to catch errors and take remedial action. This action could be something as simple as displaying an error message, or as complex as heating your computer’s innards until they burst into flame.”
