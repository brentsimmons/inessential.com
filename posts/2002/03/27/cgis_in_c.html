I must be nuts. I really, really like C. I like pointers. I don’t just use them, I <em>like</em> them. And all that memory management stuff. It’s fun.</p>

<p>I like the control, I like being close to the metal.</p>

<p>So sometimes I think the Web development language I should use is C. No scripts, no Java. C.</p>

<p>And then I think: what would I write in C?</p>

<p>I’d start with a templating system, of course, to make development easier. Gotta have templates.</p>

<p>And then of course one wants the ability to embed macros in the templates.</p>

<p>And then I realize—nuts, I’ve just re-invented Frontier, Zope, and PHP. I’m back to writing scripts!</p>

<p>Luckily this all takes place in my mind and I haven’t wasted any time on writing code.</p>

<p>But, you know, I really like writing in C.
