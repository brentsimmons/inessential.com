One of the reasons I did the <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/bigcat/">AppleScript</a> and <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/frontiercmplugin/">Frontier/Radio</a> contextual menu plugins is so that writing tool and weblog tool authors have an easy way to connect to the desktop and other apps.</p>

<p>If you’re the author of such a tool, and you’re interested in working together in some way, let me know. I’m open-minded, looking for win-wins. I can also do contextual menu plugins for classic Mac OS and Windows (for a good cause).
