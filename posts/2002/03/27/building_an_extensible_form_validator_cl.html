<a href="http://www.devshed.com/Server_Side/PHP/FormValidatorClass/page1.html">Developer Shed</a>: “I’ll be attempting to build a reusable library of functions for form input validation, in an attempt to save myself (and, hopefully, you) some time the next time an application needs to have its input checked for errors. The end result of this experiment will be a PHP class that can be easily included in your scripts, and that exposes basic object methods for data validation.”
