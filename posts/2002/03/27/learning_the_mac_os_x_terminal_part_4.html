<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/mac/2002/03/26/terminal_four.html">O’Reilly</a>: “Things really become interesting, however, when you take advantage of a little known feature of term files, the ability to define a command line to run when the window opens. Doing this allows you to create your own double-clickable run files that open in Terminal within a window of your exact specifications and run any command line (or script file) you can come up with.”
