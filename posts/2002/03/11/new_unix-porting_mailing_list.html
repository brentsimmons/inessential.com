Apple’s <a href="http://www.lists.apple.com/mailman/listinfo/unix-porting">new mailing list</a> is “for community discussions regarding all the questions people face when doing a port: What’s different about Darwin? Which high-level toolkits should I use for my GUI? Is there a workaround for this problem? Has someone tried to port this before?”
