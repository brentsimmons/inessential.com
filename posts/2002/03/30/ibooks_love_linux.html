<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/mac/2002/03/29/ibook_linux.html">O’Reilly</a>: “It feels a bit like a homecoming. After years wandering in the cranky wilderness of mix-and-match PCs I’m working again on a computer that feels like it has a soul. The reason I feel like this? The other week I switched from an Intel-based laptop to an iBook.”
