I finally added <a href="http://inessential.com/member/">membership</a> to this site. The main benefit is that you can edit your comments (those posted from this point on). More membership features to come later.</p>

<p>If you were a member of the old inessential.com, youâ€™ll have to <a href="http://inessential.com/member/signup.php">sign up</a> again. Sorry about that!</p>

<p>Ranchero.com also has <a href="http://www.ranchero.com/member/">membership</a> now. (Since it runs the same code as this site.)
