Have you wondered what kind of effect Radio has on sites with RSS feeds? Check out the <a href="http://inessential.com/stats/useragents.php">user agents</a> page. Radio occupies 8 of the top 10 spots on this site.</p>

<p>I’m not complaining, by the way. This server isn’t having any problems keeping up. It’s all good.
