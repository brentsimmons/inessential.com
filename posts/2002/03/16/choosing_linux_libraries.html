So here’s what it’s looking like: I plan to use the gnome libraries and use KDevelop as my IDE. That still could change of course.</p>

<p>I chose the gnome libraries for the simple reason that I can write in C rather than C++. I have nothing against object-oriented languages—I’m a fan of Python, Java, and Objective C, for instance—but I prefer C to C++.
