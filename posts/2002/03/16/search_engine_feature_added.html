This site now has a <a href="http://inessential.com/search.php">search engine</a>—still in beta, I need to add some features. It searches just weblog posts, but not comments or other pages (yet).</p>

<p>Search engines for your own site can be addictive. I keep finding things I wrote, and thinking, Wow, I wrote that?</p>

<p>It uses MySQL’s standard fulltext index feature. The search engine was thus very easy to write: essentially just a <code>where</code> clause.
