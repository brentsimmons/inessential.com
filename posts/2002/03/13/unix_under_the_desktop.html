I just got my mail—the April issue of Linux Journal was there. Guess what? There’s an article by me, written with <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/">Doc Searls</a>, in there. <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=5610">Unix Under the Desktop</a>, it’s called. A review of Mac OS X. Page 66.</p>

<p>I haven’t been published in print since my college newspaper. I’m proud.
