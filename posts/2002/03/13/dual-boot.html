After several days of struggling, I finally have a dual-boot Windows/Linux machine.</p>

<p>Imagine my pleasure when I discovered that <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> does anti-aliased text. Finally! That made my choice of desktop very simple. My biggest complaint with desktop Linux has long been the jaggy appearance of fonts.</p>

<p>The anti-aliasing could be of higher quality. And there should be an option to not anti-alias text below a certain size—but still, I’m pleased, those are nits.
