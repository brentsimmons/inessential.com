<a href="http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1123.html">Apple Technical Q&amp;A 1123</a>: “If you want to list all of the running applications you should use the Carbon Process Manager routine GetNextProcess. This will return a list of all application processes, including those running in the Carbon, Cocoa, and Classic environments. However, this doesn’t return a list of non-application (daemon) processes.”
