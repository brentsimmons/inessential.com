<a href="http://www.barple.connectfree.co.uk/">The Little Page of Beta AppleScripts</a>: “AWPS (Applescriptable Web Publishing System) is a template-based webpage rendering system; basically a framework into which you add your own code, templates and data, and let it do all the hard work of putting these together. The control logic (standard AppleScript) is kept completely separate to the html templates, making design and editing a snap.”
