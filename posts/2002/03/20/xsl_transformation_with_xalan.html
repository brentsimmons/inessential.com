<a href="http://www.devshed.com/Server_Side/XML/XSLXalan/page1.html">DevShed</a>: “In this article, I’m going to take things further, exploring yet another addition to the Java/XML family. It’s called Xalan, and it’s an XSLT transformation engine that should substantially simplify the task of converting, or ‘transforming,’ XML documents into other formats.”
