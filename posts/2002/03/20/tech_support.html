Sometimes tech support gets right to the point.</p>

<p>My kitten and I spent several hours yesterday trying to install a router. Now, I pride myself on being able to use mass-produced products that are designed for the average home user. But I couldn’t get this thing to work. No matter what I tried I got no net juice.</p>

<p>In exasperation I finally called tech support. I described the problem and what I did to fix it.</p>

<p>“You better take it back,” the tech support guy said.</p>

<p>No twenty questions, no assumption of stupidity—the guy knew I had a lemon and told me so. Cool.
