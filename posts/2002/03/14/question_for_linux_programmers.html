Question for Linux programmers: say I want to write a GUI app (in C or C++) that runs on both KDE and GNOME. What APIs (or frameworks) should I use? GTK or QT? Or something else? Does the answer change depending on what license I want to release my software under? What if itâ€™s GPL, what if BSD, what if commercial?
