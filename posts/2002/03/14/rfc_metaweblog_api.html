<a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi">UserLand</a>: “This API views a post as a package of metadata with some well-known names and room to grow on an organized or an ad hoc basis. In my experience those are the kinds of APIs that have legs.” I agree that an API richer than the Blogger API is needed—and that using a struct is the way to do it.
