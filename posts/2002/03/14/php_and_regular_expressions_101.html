<a href="http://www.webreference.com/programming/php/regexps/">WebReference.com</a>: “Regular expressions are simple to implement, and once you’ve mastered a few regular expressions (which are specially formatted strings that we can use to tell the regular expression engine the portion of a string we want to match) you’ll be asking yourself why you left regular expressions in the corner for so long.”
