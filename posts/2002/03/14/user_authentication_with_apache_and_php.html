<a href="http://www.devshed.com/Server_Side/PHP/UserAuth/page1.html">DevShed</a>: “As it turned out, my user authentication module had enough security holes in it to drive a few hundred dump trucks through. I spent the next week plugging those holes, and along the way learnt a number of valuable things about access control—most notably, that it’s not as easy or as obvious as you might think.”
