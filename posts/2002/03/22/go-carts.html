Last night I dreamt that me and Sheila and my extended family were racing around the streets of Paris in home-made go-carts. It was a yellow sunny day. We were all wearing old-fashioned aviator hats and goggles. There was a big pack of us. It was so fun. TV cameras appeared to cover the event, but we raced right past them. Finally we stopped for coffee. Then we raced around some more until dusk.
