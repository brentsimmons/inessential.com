<a href="http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/showarticle.php3?ID=49">Jesse Shanks</a>: “The DVD Player application comes with a scripting dictionary that allows the intrepid user to control aspects of the way the player acts, looks and responds. Besides commands to start, stop, pause and stop DVDs, there are commands for the arrow keys, the return key and ability to go to any of the menus found on a disc.”
