I posted a <a href="http://www.ranchero.com/php/rollingreferers/">small tutorial</a> with code that describes how the <a href="http://inessential.com/stats/referers.php">referers page</a> for this site and ranchero.com is done.</p>

<p>This feature is one of the many cool features in <a href="http://manila.userland.com/">Manila</a>, and I missed having it.
