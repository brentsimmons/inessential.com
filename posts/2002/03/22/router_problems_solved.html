Not to keep you all in suspense about my router issues—I ordered a new router from a different company. It arrived the next day. I plugged it in—and, much to my kitten’s delight, it worked on the very first try.</p>

<p>So now I’ve fully switched over to using my cable modem. Surprisingly, this is the first time I’ve used NAT and DHCP and had a firewall. It’s about time. I always felt naked without all that stuff.</p>

<p>To my surprise, I get faster download speeds with the cable modem than I got from my T1. It’s amazing. Of course, uploading is another matter. But it’s not too bad, it’s roughly like having a dual-channel ISDN line. (I had ISDN for a couple years back in the ’90s.)
