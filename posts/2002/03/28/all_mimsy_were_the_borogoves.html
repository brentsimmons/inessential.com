It’s funny. (Perhaps only to me.) Of all the poems ever written, the one whose first stanza I can remember best is one with a bunch of made-up words. From memory:</p>

<p>’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br />
did gyre and gimble in the wabe.<br />
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br />
and the mome raths outgrabe.
