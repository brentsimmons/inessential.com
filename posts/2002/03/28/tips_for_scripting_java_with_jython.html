<a href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2002/03/27/jython.html">O’Reilly</a>: “Jython is a complete re-implementation of the Python programming language, written in 100 percent pure Java, which runs on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Python is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented scripting language which combines elegant syntax rules with powerful built-in objects to create a language that is very easy to write, read, and maintain.”
