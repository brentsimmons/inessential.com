Paul Bissex: <a href="http://e-scribe.com/osx/mailfilter/">Mailfilter</a> is “a command-line POP client whose only job is to kill spam. It connects to your POP account, compares the headers on waiting messages to its configurable list of rules, and deletes messages accordingly—before your e-mail client even downloads it. You don’t have to change any settings in your e-mail client or on the server where your POP account resides.”
