I wrote a little piece <a href="http://ranchero.com/php/mysqlandfrontier/">explaining MySQL to Frontier users</a>.</p>

<p>“Old programmer’s philosophy: if you work primarily (or exclusively) in one environment, it’s a good idea to learn about others. It stretches your mind, helps you think more widely and imaginatively about how to solve problems.</p>

<p>“It’s the programmer’s equivalent of being ‘well-rounded,’ which always sounds like something boring like eating your brussels sprouts—but really it’s not just nutritious but fun.</p>

<p>“So the point of this article isn’t to get anyone to switch from Frontier to MySQL but just to tell you about another environment.”
