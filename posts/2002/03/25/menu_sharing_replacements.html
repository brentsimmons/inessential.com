I don’t really miss menu sharing on OS X any more.</p>

<p>First thing is that the <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/frontiercmplugin/">Frontier contextual menu plugin</a> allows one to run scripts—it replaces OSA Menu for me.</p>

<p>Next thing is all the places Apple has allowed one to attach AppleScript scripts. There’s the <a href="http://www.apple.com/applescript/macosx/script_menu/">script menu</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/applescript/macosx/toolbar_scripts/">toolbar scripts</a>, and Script Runner. The key with those is that you can use AppleScript scripts to run a script in Frontier or Radio. Just send a doscript message to Frontier.</p>

<p>Another thing is that many apps—Eudora, AppleWorks, and BBEdit, for example—have a Scripts menu where you can attach AppleScript scripts. Again, you just use a small AppleScript script to run a script in Radio or Frontier.</p>

<p>It’s not quite as convenient as menu sharing—but, if you add it all up, you end up with an environment that’s at least as scriptable and customizable as classic Mac OS.
