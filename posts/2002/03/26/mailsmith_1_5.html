<a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/mailsmith.html">BareBones</a>: “Not only is Mailsmith a scriptable mail client—giving you scripting access to checking mail, sending messages, and moving messages between mailboxes—but it’s also a fully scriptable text editor. Most AppleScripts written for BBEdit work in Mailsmith.”
