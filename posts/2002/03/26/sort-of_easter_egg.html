It’s not uncommon for programmers to want to leave their mark on a product they’ve worked on. Some sort of small Easter egg or something, something personal. Some kind of signature.</p>

<p>I’ve never given in to that temptation. Except once, that is, in a very small way.</p>

<p>On the Manila Appearance Prefs page, in the pop-up menu where it asks what date format you want to use for the home page, the example date is March 26, my birthday.</p>

<p>I had to pick a date—any date would do—and the first one that popped into my head was that date. So why not?
