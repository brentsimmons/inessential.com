<a href="http://softwaredev.earthweb.com/sdtech/article/0,,12065_994411,00.html">developer.com</a>: “The foundation of any build process is the project directory structure. A messy project directory, cluttered with files dropped willy nilly into whatever directory the ‘file save’ dialog happened to open up with, leads to arcane and bug-prone build scripts. On the other hand, if you try to organize too compulsively, you can end up with a byzantine nest of sub-sub-subdirectories that make it tedious to find the files you’re looking for.”
