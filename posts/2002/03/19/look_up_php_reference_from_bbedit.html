Many years ago I was trying to learn AppleScript and just not getting it. Nothing against AppleScript—everybody’s brain is wired differently. For me, a language that seems like natural language but really isn’t was just confusing.</p>

<p>But that’s just me. While struggling with AppleScript I discovered Frontier, and it immediately clicked for me.</p>

<p>Since then I’ve learned lots of other languages, but AppleScript has always been the language that stumps me. Which is why I’m proud to have finally written a useful AppleScript script.</p>

<p>The following is a script for BBEdit.  If you write PHP scripts in BBEdit it’s useful.</p>

<p>This script allows you to select some text then search for it on the PHP site. Drop it in your Scripts folder as a compiled script. On my machine I called it Look Up PHP Function. Here’s the source:</p>

<pre class="scriptcode">
set s to ""
set searchurl to "http://www.php.net/manual-lookup.php?pattern="

tell application "BBEdit 6.5"
   set s to selection of text window 1 as text
end tell

set searchurl to searchurl & s

tell application "Internet Explorer"
   Activate
   OpenURL searchurl
end tell
</pre>

<p>It’s pretty simple—it creates a URL by appending the selected text to a base URL. Then it tells Internet Explorer to open that URL. You could probably change the Web browser and it would still work.
