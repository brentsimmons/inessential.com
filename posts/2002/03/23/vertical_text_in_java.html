<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/mac/2002/03/22/vertical_text.html">O’Reilly</a>: “If you’re developing your application using Java on the Macintosh, you may have noticed that Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines specify vertical text in side tabs, but Java only supports horizontal text. To address this, I wrote the VTextIcon class, which manages vertical text with support for localization.”
