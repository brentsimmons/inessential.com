<a href="http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/Sample_Code/Cocoa/DeskPictAppDockMenu.htm">New Cocoa sample code</a> from Apple “shows how to add a dock menu to your Cocoa application, so that clicking and holding on your application’s dock icon displays a menu. It demonstrates this by scanning a folder of your choice (which you can choose from the ‘Preferences...’ menu item) for pictures, displaying those pictures in the dock menu, and setting your desktop picture to the picture you choose from the menu.”
