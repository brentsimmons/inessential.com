<a href="http://www.devshed.com/Server_Side/PHP/PHPRDF/page1.html">Developer Shed</a>: “Imagine a site that carried the latest news from the hottest portals on the Web. Stock prices, weather information, news stories, threaded discussions, software releases...all updated dynamically, on an hourly basis, without any manual intervention. Imagine the traffic such a site would get.”
