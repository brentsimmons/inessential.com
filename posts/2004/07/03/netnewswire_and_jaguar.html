<p>To be clear, in my <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=2877">previous post</a> I’m thinking out loud about requiring Panther for NetNewsWire 2.0.</p>

<p>It’s just thinking, though. No decision has been made, I’m just bringing up the topic.</p>

<p>But if you’re a NetNewsWire user who uses Jaguar, I’d especially love to hear what you think. (And I’d like to know why you’re still on Jaguar. I’m sure there are good reasons I haven’t thought of.)</p>
