<p>Happy Fourth of July!</p>

<p>Three years ago I posted a list of <a href="http://inessential.com/2001/07/04.html">some cool American people and things</a>.</p>

<p>Sheila’s family descends from ethnic Germans living in Romania—and she posted some more <a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/2004/07/04">pictures</a> from her recent trip. One of the things I love about America is immigration, past and present.</p>

<p>The Statue of Liberty, a gift from France, holds a tablet with the date July 4, 1776 in Roman numerals: July IV MDCCLXXVI.</p>

<p>Today’s date, in Roman numerals: July IV MMIV.</p>
