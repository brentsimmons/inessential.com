<p>After listening to all the feedback (here and elsewhere) on this issue, we’ve decided to support Jaguar in NetNewsWire 2.0.</p>

<p>Jaguar was the first really good OS X release, and we’d support it forever if we could, but some day we’ll have to drop it. Not yet, though.</p>

<p>In case you’re curious, here’s why we decided to continue to support Jaguar:</p>

<p>1. We can provide the Panther-only features we want to provide without dropping Jaguar support.</p>

<p>The main thing is searching. SearchKit is part of Panther but not part of Jaguar, so Jaguar users just won’t get this feature, but Panther users will.</p>

<p>2. It would be more work at this point to switch over to Panther-only than to stick with Jaguar compatibility.</p>

<p>To switch over to using things like Cocoa bindings—which make our life easier but don’t provide new features to users—would mean more work. At some point, yes, we’ll make the switch, but only when there are other compelling reasons to drop Jaguar support.</p>

<p>Anyway, that’s the scoop.</p>

<p>Thanks for all the feedback!</p>
