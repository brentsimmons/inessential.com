<p>Most folks, when they say “let’s go to the mall,” they mean the local mall—it’s just The Mall, it doesn’t need a name.</p>

<p>And many folks remember The Mall from their teenage years forever. Every mall later on is viewed through the filter of that First Mall, the Ur-Mall.</p>

<p>For me that mall was the Christiana Mall in Delaware. <a href="http://macnn.com/news/25388">MacNN reports</a> that they’re getting an Apple store. I haven’t been there in almost 20 years, but for some reason this made me glad.</p>

<p>We used to walk around The Mall talking out loud about rats, hoping to spook the other shoppers. People gave us funny looks but we never managed to cause a stampede.</p>
