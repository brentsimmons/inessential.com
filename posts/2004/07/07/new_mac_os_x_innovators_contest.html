<p>O’Reilly has announced a new <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/developer/2004/07/06/innovators.html">Mac OS X Innovators Contest</a>, with the award to be presented at this year’s OS X conference in October.</p>

<p>If you’re an OS X developer, no matter how small, I encourage you to enter the contest. It was a great thing for us (NetNewsWire won last year in the first contest)—and it would have been a good learning experience even had we not won, since in entering we had to write about our application succinctly and describe why anyone would be interested in it. (Which is a valuable thing to be able to do.)</p>

<p>I’ll be attending the conference, and I look forward to congratulating the winners—which could be you!</p>
