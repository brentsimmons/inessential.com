Now and again Iâ€™ve thought about making a NetNewsWire screensaver, since it would be cool to have your screensaver show you the latest news.</p>

<p>But now I donâ€™t have to do itâ€”the softoBe folks have released <a href="http://www.softobe.com/products/m3dw/pp.html">Mac3DWatch</a>. I havenâ€™t tried it out yet, but from the screen shots it looks pretty cool.
