Now and again I’ve thought about making a NetNewsWire screensaver, since it would be cool to have your screensaver show you the latest news.</p>

<p>But now I don’t have to do itâ€”the softoBe folks have released <a href="http://www.softobe.com/products/m3dw/pp.html">Mac3DWatch</a>. I haven’t tried it out yet, but from the screen shots it looks pretty cool.
