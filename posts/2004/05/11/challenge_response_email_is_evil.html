I detest challenge/response email.</p>

<p>Last week a journalist sent me some interview questions. I answered them later that day.</p>

<p>Then today I got an email me asking me if I would have time to answer the questions, since the article is nearly due.</p>

<p>Clearly my reply didn’t get to the journalist. I was wondering why, and then I noticed his email address and went to the website. It’s one of those spam-blocking systems that uses challenge and response.</p>

<p>I don’t remember seeing a challenge. But I might have seen it and thought it was spam—or my spam-filter might have thought it was spam.</p>

<p>The upshot is that I get way too much email to deal with challenges to a reply to an email conversation <i>that someone else initiated</i>. I can understand a challenge if I’m emailing someone out-of-the-blue, but not if I’m replying to an email.</p>

<p>So I replied again, pasted in my answers, and crossed my fingers that he’ll get my email. I’m watching my trash for a challenge from his email system. This is stupid.</p>

<p>So if you see an article about Atom and RSS and it says something like “NetNewsWire author Brent Simmons could not be reached for comment”—then you know why.
