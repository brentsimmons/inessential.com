I’m home alone (Sheila is traveling in Romania with family), and I’m not used to being home alone.</p>

<p>It’s been a week, and I’ve started to develop weird habits. Here’s how dinner works: I make spaghetti, eat left-overs for a few days, panic over what to have for dinner, make spaghetti, then eat left-overs for a few days.</p>

<p>It’s a really good thing I like spaghetti.
