There’s an <a href="http://rss.weblogsinc.com/entry/5225556132366423/">interview with me</a> at The RSS Weblog.</p>

<p>Interviews make me a little nervous. It’s hard to know if you’re coming across as a freak or not.</p>

<p>One thing I like about interviewers is that they’re smart enough to <i>not</i> use some of the stuff I send them. For instance, Harold asked me for some biographical data, and I wrote the following (which he wisely didn’t use):</p>

<p><blockquote>I once tried to catch a frisbee in my mouth and got a bloody lip. Another time a crow dropped a partially-eaten english muffin through the sun-roof of a car (I was in the back seat) and the muffin stuck, butter-side, to my shirt, right above my heart.</blockquote>
