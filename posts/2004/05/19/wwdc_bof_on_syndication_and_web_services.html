At WWDC there will be a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/community.html">Birds of a Feather</a> meeting called “RSS, Web Services and Online Content in Cocoa Apps.”</p>

<p><a href="http://fraserspeirs.livejournal.com/">Fraser Speirs</a> asked me if I would participate, and I said I’d be happy to. So, if you’re going to be at WWDC, and this stuff interests you, I hope to see you there.
