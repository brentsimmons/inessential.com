So Sheila’s in Transylvania for a couple weeks doing some family things, and my cat Papa and I are looking at each other wondering who’s going to deal with all the things.</p>

<p>His stare says, hey, you’re the monkey with the brain, you’ve got the cool thumbs, <i>you</i> do stuff, I’m going to curl up and dream about rabbits.</p>

<p>Well, I think, okay.
