I got a tip I’ll pass along on dealing with the OS X security bug.</p>

<p>If you change the protocol helper for "help" URLs, then the script should not run. I downloaded the <a href="http://www.monkeyfood.com/software/moreInternet/">More Internet Preference Pane</a> and changed the handler for "help" to the Finder.</p>

<p>It turns out that the bug is more widespread than WebKit—even non-WebKit browsers such as Camino may be vulnerable.</p>

<p>(Thanks to Rob McNair-Huff of <a href="http://www.whiterabbits.com/macnetjournal/">Mac Net Journal</a> for the tip.)
