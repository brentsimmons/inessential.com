I got my first bug-tracker spam today. It was just a matter of time, I suppose. (And there was a fresh round of comments spam today.)</p>

<p>Spammers are the thugs of the Internet.</p>

<p>I’m constantly amazed by just how <i>bad</i> some people are. Maybe it’s because I’m getting farther and farther away from my school years, when every day I interacted with a wide variety of people. It doesn’t surprise a 12-year-old when people suck. But me, I’m surprised.</p>

<p>Spammers aren’t on the same level as torturers or even purse-stealers. But I think that, given a different context, they’d be happy to toss some books in a bonfire in the city square.</p>

<p><i>Update:</i> More about Net thugs... but with a happier conclusion. See Zeldman on the <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0504h.shtml">Andy Kaufman</a> effect.
