We get enough support requests to have some idea of the things people often don’t know about Mac OS X.</p>

<p>So here are a couple things I wish every Mac OS X user knew.
</p>
<h4>Toolbars are (frequently) customizable</h4>
<p>
In many applications you can reorganize the toolbar and add and remove buttons. </p>

<p>Often there’s a Customize Toolbar command in the View menu. If not, often you can ctrl-click on the toolbar and choose Customize Toolbar.</p>

<p>If an application doesn’t have a toolbar button that you wish it had, it might actually have it—if you choose Customize Toolbar you can see all the buttons.</p>

<p>There is nothing magical about the default set of buttons for any given app. There’s every expectation (and hope!) that you’ll customize the toolbar to your liking.
</p>
<h4>Drag and drop is your friend</h4>
<p>
In theory, drag and drop is great because it’s an intuitive, easy way to do certain types of things. It makes sense to directly manipulate objects that appear on the screen.</p>

<p>In practice—at least in my experience—drag and drop is used mostly by power users. My provisional explanation for this is that drag and drop is outside the select-object/click-verb model which is the first thing you learn when you learn computers.</p>

<p>Me, I do drag and drop all the time: I tend to assume there will be support for it when I need it, and I’m usually right.</p>

<p>An example: the other day I was helping upgrade a family member’s Mac to OS X. We wanted to import his photos into iPhoto. I hadn’t used iPhoto myself—but I assumed you could drag a folder from the Finder into the albums list in the upper-left corner and it would create an album. It worked!</p>

<p>An important point about drag and drop—a point that people often miss—is that it often works between two different applications. If you use Mail, I think it’s fairly obvious that you can drag a message from your inbox to another mailbox. What is less obvious is that can drag a link to your desktop, drag text into a text editor, and so on.
