I’ve written before about writing <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=2727">effective bug reports</a>.</p>

<p>Whenever I go through the online bug tracker for MarsEdit and NetNewsWire, I get lots of great bug reports.</p>

<p>But I also get a few bug reports that go something like this: “Support for tags is broken.”</p>

<p>(This is a made-up example, but it’s no more terse and non-specific than some actual bug reports.)</p>

<p>What can I do with these? I mark them as closed and make a note about not having enough information. Still, it gets me that there’s some reason the report was made, and I wish I knew what it was.</p>

<p>It may or may not be a bug in the code—it could be a user interface design flaw, or a mistake in the Help book, for instance.</p>

<p>Or it might be that the user expectation doesn’t match the application. (Example: sometimes we get bug reports that NetNewsWire can’t connect to such-and-such Usenet server.)</p>

<p>But it could as easily be a real bug in the code. Without details, how could I know?</p>
