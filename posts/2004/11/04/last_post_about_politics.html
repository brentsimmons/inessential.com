This is my last post about politics for now... I’ve already unsubscribed from a bunch of political weblogs.</p>

<p>The last thing I wanted to say was that I’ve seen liberals hating conservatives and conservatives hating liberals. There are jerks—some really, truly awful people—on both sides. But most people are trying hard to do what they think is right.</p>

<p>Me, I voted the way I did because I thought my candidate would do the better job at national security and at bringing peace, democracy, and stability to Iraq. I thought my candidate was stronger.</p>

<p>Of course, there are millions of people who could have written that last paragraph, and roughly half voted for the other guy. That just means that it’s a democracy and we disagreed.</p>

<p>This election is over, but the future of America is still decided day-by-day, person-by-person.
