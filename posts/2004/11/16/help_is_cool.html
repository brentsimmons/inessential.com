Here’s another thing I wish all Mac OS X users knew...</p>

<p>It used to be that choosing Help from the Help menu was something you wanted to avoid at all costs. In 10.2 and earlier, the Help viewer application took forever to launch.</p>

<p>But, starting with OS X 10.3 (Panther), the Help viewer app launches much more quickly and is all-around a pretty cool application. The user interface is simple—and that’s exactly how it should be. (You don’t want to have to get help to learn how to use the Help viewer, after all.)</p>

<p>In other words—don’t be afraid of looking in the Help! I think you’ll find that many developers work pretty hard on their Help books and they’re actually quite useful.</p>

<p>One of the cool things about Help is that it’s searchable and the searching is fast.
