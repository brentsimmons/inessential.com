Call me Adam.</p>

<p>I knew I shouldn’t oughter-a-done-it, and I feel a little ashamed inside, but I went ahead and <strike>bit the apple</strike> used Cocoa bindings.</p>

<p>It was, I confess, a reaction to that terrible feeling you get when you’re faced with creating <i>yet another</i> NSTableView data source and delegate. I just couldn’t face another objectValueForTableColumn:blah:blah:whatever:.</p>

<p>How silly it seems now—what’s one more data source among so many?—but my emotions got the best of me, and I went ahead and created—yes, say it, admit it—an array controller in Interface Builder, and I bound that damn table.</p>

<p>And I liked it!</p>

<p>It was for the pings list in MarsEdit, the last tab in the weblog settings window. I had resisted Cocoa bindings because I had planned originally that MarsEdit would run on Jaguar.</p>

<p>And it almost did—except for some weird stuff that was going to be very difficult to work around. So I left open the possibility that a Jaguar version would not happen—and, by using Cocoa bindings (which don’t exist in 10.2) that decision was finally made.</p>

<p><img src="http://inessential.com/images/atom.gif" width="29" height="30" alt="" /></p>

<p>But now I’m tempted—<i>very, very tempted</i>—to go through MarsEdit and delete a ton of code and switch to Cocoa bindings everywhere.</p>

<p>You just don’t do that in a beta app. It Would Be Wrong. So I Won’t.</p>

<p>But still... that apple tasted so sweet.
