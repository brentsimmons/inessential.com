Call me a democracy junkie. Election day is like catnip.</p>

<p>Once you’ve voted, I’m curious about what you saw.</p>

<p>Long lines or short? Was it raining or sunny? Did you see lots of election observers? Were people arriving by the van-load or was it pretty quiet? Any interesting stories? Etc.</p>

<p>I’m just curious about what voting is like, today, where you are. Details appreciated!
