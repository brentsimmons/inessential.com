<a href="http://ranchero.com/2004/02/11.php">Yesterday</a> Sheila posted on ranchero.com that it was NetNewsWire’s first birthday—and now today we have a small present for you.</p>

<p>But first, a note about birthdays: the <a href="http://ranchero.com/2002/07/12.php">first beta</a> of NetNewsWire Lite appeared going on <em>two</em> years ago. So if it seems like you’ve been using NetNewsWire for more than a year, it’s probably because you have.</p>

<p>Anyway, today we’ve posted a <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/atombeta/">special Atom beta</a> for testing NetNewsWire’s Atom parser.</p>

<p>Atom support is part of NetNewsWire 1.1—but this build is not a build of 1.1, it’s really 1.0.8-plus-Atom. NetNewsWire 1.1 will have a bunch of new features, but this build is just for testing the Atom parser.
