If you have one of those microwaves with a spinning platter, try this experiment:</p>

<p>1. Put some water in a mug with a handle.</p>

<p>2. Put the mug in the microwave; run it for a minute or two.</p>

<p>3. When the microwave stops, note the position of the mug handle.</p>

<p>If you’re right-handed, the mug handle will be at about 10 o’clock every time, the most awkward position for picking up a container of hot liquid.</p>

<p>You can’t reach around it without risking touching the hot mug with the inside of your wrist or forearm. You have to use your left hand.</p>

<p>(It’s possible this isn’t universal—it could just be me this happens to.)
