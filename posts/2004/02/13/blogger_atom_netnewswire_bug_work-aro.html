We found a bug after releasing the special Atom beta of NetNewsWire yesterday.</p>

<p>If a feed has summaries but no content, NetNewsWire ignores the summaries—and items display in NetNewsWire as titles only.</p>

<p>We’ve seen this so far with some Blogger weblogs. (To be clear: it’s not a Blogger bug.) Though we’ll fix the bug in a future release, in the meantime, if you have a Blogger weblog and you want to work around it, you can.</p>

<p>On the settings for your site’s feed, under Descriptions, choose Full instead of Short. Here’s a <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/bloggerFeedSettings.jpg">screen shot</a>.
