So here’s how software development goes sometimes.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on NetNewsWire’s error reporting when a download fails—and, suddenly, out of 193 feeds on my dev machine, there are no download errors. No DNS errors, no timeouts, just 193 out of 193 downloads.</p>

<p>You can tell me it’s impossible, and I’d say that normally it is—except that the Web behaves in diabolical ways when confronted with a developer with a compiler.
