I’m thinking ahead to the general election.</p>

<p>Both parties will try to set the agenda, of course. (They’re supposed to do that.) The Republicans will talk about three things, I think:</p>

<p>1. Which candidate will continue to take the war on terror to where the terrorists live?</p>

<p>2. Which candidate will keep the IRS from grabbing all your hard-earned money?</p>

<p>3. Which candidate will prevent homosexuals from destroying marriage as we know it?</p>

<p>That’s three things, national security, economy, and values.</p>

<p>Lots of people have suggested that this general election will be about one of the first two, national security or the economy.</p>

<p>But I have a feeling that it may be about values. It will be about civil unions.</p>

<p>I’m remembering Dukakis. During a debate he was asked about his stand on the death penalty—but he was asked in a very personal way. He was asked what he would do were his wife murdered.</p>

<p>His answer should have reflected some emotion that people could relate to. Instead he gave a dry, dispassionate answer about why he’s against the death penalty. It made him seem not exactly human, and it played right into the stereotype of clinical liberals from the northeast.</p>

<p>I imagine Bush or a moderator asking a similar question of the Democratic nominee, but this time it’s “What would you do if your son married another man?”</p>

<p>How could you possibly answer this question? You support civil unions. But this is about you and your family, and people want an answer they can relate to.</p>

<p>It’s not as black-and-white as the question Dukakis answered. You can’t express elation or disgust, anger or joy, but you have to express something.</p>

<p>Looking months into the future, I can imagine where in a close election the whole thing may turn on the answer to this question.
