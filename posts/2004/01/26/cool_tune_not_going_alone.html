Paul Kimball (a good friend from my college days) posted his first GarageBand composition, <a href="http://www.icompositions.com/auditorium1/showphoto.php?photo=261">Not Going Alone</a>.</p>

<p>I first heard it last night, and it’s still in my head this morning. It’s more demo than radio-ready, of course, but the feel of it comes through with the everyman guitar sound and especially the melody and harmonies and Paul’s singing.
