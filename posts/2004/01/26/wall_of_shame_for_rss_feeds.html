I get bug reports every day about feeds that don’t display correctly in NetNewsWire. At least 99% of the time it’s because the feed is invalid, but not so invalid that NetNewsWire gives up on it.</p>

<p>Most of the time I encourage the person who submitted the bug report to report the bug to the feed producer. I have no idea how often that happens—at any rate, it seems to have little affect. Some feeds (some popular feeds, even) stay broken.</p>

<p>Somebody suggested creating a wall of shame for broken RSS feeds. (I apologize: I don’t remember who suggested it.)</p>

<p>Part of me loves the idea. I’d create a weblog where I and other people could post reports of broken feeds.</p>

<p>But I don’t really like the idea because it’s so, well, negative. The big picture is to <em>encourage</em> syndication, not play syndication cop.</p>

<p>(Imagine a site saying that they took down their RSS feed because the syndication police kept bugging them. It would happen.)</p>

<p>Anyway, in short—wall of shame, no. But I’m still thinking about ways to boost the quality of feeds.
