Here’s what confuses me:</p>

<p>Some people say that TV inaccurately portrays Dean as angry.</p>

<p>I don’t know where that comes from.</p>

<p>Dean built his campaign on the idea that you can use the Internet to build a grass-roots movement of people who are angry at Bush over the Iraq War, the Patriot Act, unemployment, and the environment.</p>

<p>It worked—he tapped into an already-existing anger. He was an angry person leading angry people. Why not? Maybe people thought they had really good reasons to be angry at Bush.</p>

<p>If the war isn’t just, if people died for no good cause; if our liberties are being taken away for cynical and mean reasons; if the environment and the economy are being destroyed to line the pockets of friends of Bush... if you think all that, I don’t see how you can avoid being angry.</p>

<p>Maybe Dean wants to appeal to a broader set of people by appearing more Presidential and less angry. That’s probably the right move to make right now. But blaming TV for reporting on Dean’s anger seems surreal to me.
