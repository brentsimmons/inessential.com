If you have a Mac, and you’re listening to the RSS WinterFest webcast, how did you manage it? I can’t seem to figure it out. I get an error “Session may not exist; Requested format may be wrong or general error.”</p>

<p>Update: Never mind—Sheila figured it out.</p>

<p>Update 2: And Alex Williams sent me the correct URL to use.
