In the past I’ve mentioned that I have an RSS feed for the comments to my site. For me personally it’s more useful than email notification of comments.</p>

<p>It turns out that Adam Rice has a <a href="http://www.crossroads.net/a/tmpls/cf.tmpl">comments feed template</a> that works with Movable Type. (You may need to view source to see it.) There are probably other such templates, for Movable Type and other systems.</p>

<p>What I’m saying is—if you’re already using a newsreader, and you have a weblog, and you don’t have a comments feed, try it out, you may be surprised by how much you like it.</p>

<p>Update: Adam Rice wrote in the <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=2778">comments</a> to say that credit should be given where due. Absolutely right. Adam’s template is based on one created by Mark Pilgrim.
