Robb Beal asks: <a href="http://www.usercreations.com/weblog/2004/01/17.html#a420">Why do they ignore the indie apps</a>?</p>

<p>He’s talking about when someone writes about user experience: why write just about Apple’s apps?</p>

<p>I have a couple ideas why:</p>

<p>1. Apple can take it.</p>

<p>If the piece is very critical (as it often is)—such criticism could hurt the sales and reputation of a small developer disproportionately.</p>

<p>Say I don’t like how app x (by small developer y) does something, and I notice that, say, Mail or iCal or whatever does the same thing. I’m going to write about the Apple app.</p>

<p>2. Mac users all use software from Apple, so your audience knows what you’re talking about.</p>

<p>Even if an article is talking about a specific app you don’t use, there’s a good chance you have it in your Applications folder and can launch it. No need to download and install anything new.</p>

<p>People write for an audience, and writing about Apple software has more of a built-in audience.</p>

<p>Update: see the comments—Buzz Andersen makes the point that <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=2787">indie apps are talked about all the time</a>.</p>

<p>Update 2: don’t misunderstand—Robb is talking about writing about user interface, not about writing about indie apps in general.</p>

<p>Update 3: You might think that I’m complaining about NetNewsWire coverage or coverage of indie apps here. I’m not! I’m replying to something Robb Beal said, and saying why I think there are good reasons that people who write about user interface often write about Apple apps.
