Just about every day I talk with people who want to start a Macintosh software business.</p>

<p>People have all kinds of questions: can I make money at this? How much should I charge for my app? Where should I advertise? Should I do my idea as a plugin or as a separate app? What e-commerce provider should I use? Should I get a booth at Macworld?</p>

<p>I have opinions on some of these questions, but there are tons of things I don’t know about, and I have questions too sometimes.</p>

<p>So I decided to start a <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/macsb/">new mailing list</a> on Yahoo Groups.</p>

<p>The description: “This group is for small, independent Macintosh developers who want to talk with other developers about the business of Mac development. Questions on pricing, packaging, advertising, e-commerce providers, and so on are on-topic. Note that this list isn’t a vehicle for promotion: announcements and press releases are off-topic.”</p>

<p>(You don’t have to have a business up-and-running already: it’s for people who want to start a business too.)
