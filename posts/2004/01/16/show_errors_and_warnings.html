A tip for Xcode users...</p>

<p>One of the things about Xcode is that, when a build has errors or warnings, it’s not as obvious as it was in Project Builder.</p>

<p>So what I did was assign a keyboard shortcut—shift-cmd-E—to the command to show errors and warnings. It’s become automatic after doing a build: I hit that shortcut to see what happened.
