I’ve been waiting 20 years for <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/">GarageBand</a>.</p>

<p>Back in the early ’80s, when I was a teenager—before there were even Macs—I had an Apple II Plus with a cool piece of software named <a href="http://comp_sounds.tripod.com/alfsynth.html">ALF</a> II. (This was even before the sitcom named Alf.)</p>

<p>(Actually, it wasn’t just software: there was a card you had to plug into the computer.)</p>

<p>It was something like an early, early GarageBand—you could create music and save songs and play them back. The music played through some car-stereo speakers I plugged in to the ALF card.</p>

<p>You had to actually enter notes into a staff on-screen, using the twin roller-paddle-things that came with the Apple II Plus. (No mice yet, at least not for the mass market.) There was no way to plug in an instrument and just play.</p>

<p>It had up to nine tracks, and it had some basic things like setting the synthesizer settings and telling sections of a track to repeat.</p>

<p>It was cumbersome and the sound was totally electronic, but it worked. I made dozens of songs. I loved it.</p>

<p>And I’ve been waiting 20 years for the chance to do that again. Sure, I could have had this already, but for a bunch more money. Since composing music was just a hobby for me, I never wanted to spend a bunch on music software. Now I don’t have to.</p>

<p>This software excites me personally far beyond anything Apple has announced since OS X. More than iPhoto, iTunes, Safari, iPods, and everything else put together.</p>

<p>Of course, I haven’t actually tried it yet, but it only has to be half as good as the demo to be a wonderful (to me, at least) piece of software.
