Whenever we update the Sites Drawer (the list of feeds that comes with NetNewsWire) I look at a bunch of feeds and their descriptions.</p>

<p>Here are some descriptions from the list, just to give you a flavor:</p>

<p>Random Ramblings Regularly<br />
Rants, raves, and random thoughts on life and American culture<br />
Rants on spam, business, digital music, patents, and other assorted random stuff.<br />
random thoughts on games, art, geek culture and living in new york.<br />
random and occassionally coherent musings<br />
random musings and explorations from the mind of [withheld]<br />
random thoughts and ramblings</p>

<p>The people have voted! If anyone ever asks you what a weblog is, you can state, with confidence, that itâ€™s <em>random rants, ramblings, and musings</em>. </p>

<p>It is also, on occasion, punditry. And good old-fashioned commentary is not unheard-of.
