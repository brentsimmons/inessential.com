I kind of got sucked into <a href="http://orkut.com/">Orkut</a> for a little while on the weekend, though I haven’t done much with it since. I’ve registered with a few of the other services too, but I haven’t used them much.</p>

<p>I’m curious—what do you think about these services? Do you use them? If so, is it mostly for fun, or is it an important part of your work? What things do you like about them?
