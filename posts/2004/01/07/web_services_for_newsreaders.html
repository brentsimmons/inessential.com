If you haven’t seen <a href="http://feeds.scripting.com/">feeds.scripting.com</a> yet, it’s a place you can share your OPML subscriptions files. It has a rankings page so you can see what’s popular, you can see who subscribes to a given feed, and if you’re a member of the site there are a few other cool features.</p>

<p>Other web sites have some similar features, of course. (<a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a> is one of my favorites.) I bring up feeds.scripting.com because it’s new and so it’s a good time to ask what you think about web services for newsreaders.</p>

<p>We at Ranchero don’t plan to create any web services. But we do plan to make NetNewsWire work with various newsreader-oriented web services—so here are a couple questions:</p>

<p>1. What existing web services interest you?</p>

<p>Examples: you might wish NetNewsWire uploaded OPML files automatically to feeds.scripting.com or somewhere. Or you might wish NetNewsWire made it easy to create <a href="http://www.feedster.com/">Feedster</a> search feeds. And so on.</p>

<p>And here’s the bigger question...</p>

<p>2. What new web services would you like to see?</p>

<p>I have to admit, I don’t spend much time thinking about web services, so no really good examples come to mind. And there are actually a number of good services out there already, some of them under-publicized, so it may be that a bunch of good ideas have already been done.</p>

<p>But I bet you can come up with some new ones.
