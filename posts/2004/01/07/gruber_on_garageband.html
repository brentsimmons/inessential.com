<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/01/a_big_garage">John Gruber</a>: “What’s so cool about GarageBand is that it exemplifies the market that Apple is going after. People who want to use their computers to make cool things. People who want to be producers, not just consumers.”</p>

<p>I’ll add one thing to that: of all the iLife apps, iTunes is the most important but the least interesting. It’s important for obvious reasons, because of iPods and the music store and that it runs on Windows.</p>

<p>But it’s the least interesting because you don’t actually create music with it. You create playlists, sure, but that’s not the same level of creativity as creating the actual music (or taking pictures or making movies and DVDs). iTunes is like shopping in a really great art gallery, but it’s not the same as being a painter.
