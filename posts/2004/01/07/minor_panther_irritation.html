Here’s something that changed in Panther that drives me nuts several times a day:</p>

<p>1. I often hit cmd-option-h to hide everything but the app I’m working in.</p>

<p>2. Then later I want to hide the app I’m working in and get back to the Finder, so I hit cmd-H.</p>

<p>3. I expect the current app to hide and the Finder to become active.</p>

<p>4. But nothing happens. (On Jaguar the current app hides and the Finder becomes active, as I expect.)
