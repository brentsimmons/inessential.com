<a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2004/01/04#755">Ted Leung follows up</a> to my post from <a href="http://inessential.com/2004/01/03.php">yesterday</a> with more about RSS and gzip compression.</p>

<p>“So I’ve been looking at the statistics, and it’s not looking good out there folks,” Ted writes. “As far as gzipped feeds go, about 10% of the feeds in my NNW (about 900) are gzipped.”
