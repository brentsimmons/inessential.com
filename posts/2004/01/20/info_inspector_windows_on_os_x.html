Here’s something interesting—to me, anyway, as an OS X developer.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of standardization on the various types of windows in OS X. For instance, preferences windows are usually either windows with a toolbar or a set of tabs. Look at the preferences for Safari, for example: you choose which preferences to edit by clicking an icon in a toolbar. Same thing with Transmit, NetNewsWire, OmniOutliner, and on and on.</p>

<p>But there is much less standardization for Info/Inspector windows. (I mean the windows that appear that tell you more about your selection; what you get when you hit cmd-I or shift-cmd-I.)</p>

<p>In no particular order, here’s a list of some of the different styles I found:</p>

<p>1. The Finder has disclosure triangles for expanding/collapsing.</p>

<p>2. OmniOutliner is similar to the Finder but instead uses a button that extends most of the width of the window.</p>

<p>3. OmniGraffle uses a toolbar that includes a popup menu for choosing which information to look at.</p>

<p>4. NetNewsWire has no toolbar or tabs or anything since it doesn’t display that much information. Transmit’s is cosmetically different but the same basic style.</p>

<p>5. iTunes has a big window with tabs and Previous and Next buttons. It’s actually modal, to my surprise.</p>

<p>6. iCal uses a drawer rather than a separate window.</p>

<p>7. Terminal and Interface Builder are like OmniGraffle with its popup menu, but with no toolbar.</p>

<p>8. xCode has tabs (like iTunes), but it’s not modal and there are no previous and next buttons.</p>

<p>9. BBEdit has an info window somewhat like NetNewsWire’s and Transmit’s in that it doesn’t have multiple pages, but it’s modal.</p>

<p>It looks to me as if two basic styles are needed, one for info windows with a little info and one for info windows with multiple panes. I think the first case is pretty well solved: it’s the second case where a convention would be useful.</p>

<p>I’m not proposing anything, by the way, I’m just saying that a convention would be helpful to developers and users.
