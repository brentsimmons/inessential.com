In a <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=2770">comment to a previous post</a>, Scott Palmer suggested that I’m wrong about being strict with Atom parsing. Scott wrote, “The key is not the code, the key is the customer. You have a GREAT user focus, please keep it.”</p>

<p>My reply was that I’m being strict <em>because</em> of my user focus.</p>

<p>Here’s my new slogan: Don’t let bad feeds punish good users.</p>

<p>Every minute I spend making my Atom parser more forgiving of not-well-formed XML is a minute taken away from working on features people are asking for, things like searching and synching and everything else.</p>

<p>If there are some bad feeds out there—and there will be, no matter what—it’s not fair to NetNewsWire users if I spend time dealing with these feeds.</p>

<p>And if NetNewsWire is strict, it may make it more likely that Atom feed producers will produce good XML, which is good for NetNewsWire users.
