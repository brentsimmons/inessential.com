On the subject of NetNewsWire requiring that Atom feeds be well-formed XML, Mark Pilgrim <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=2770">wrote</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote>A member of the RSS advisory board -- a group whose charter explicitly states that you "advocate for RSS" -- has announced that he will use his product&#039;s dominant market position to punish his own paying customers by applying a double standard that makes Atom appear less useful than RSS.</p>

<p>I&#039;m not usually given to conspiracy theories, but Jesus H. Christ, are you f$@#ing kidding me?</blockquote></p>

<p>Good question.</p>

<p>I’m not trying to cut down on Atom’s chance of being popular. On the contrary—what I haven’t expressed is that I’m <em>excited</em> by the chance to do this right, to not have the ugly workarounds in my code that exist just to parse that minority of bad RSS feeds.</p>

<p>I certainly didn’t discuss my decision with other members of the RSS board.</p>

<p>If Atom’s popularity is dependent on whether parsers are liberal or not, then that’s a problem with Atom, or Atom feed generators, not the parsers. I don’t think that this is the case: I think Atom will be popular whether parsers are strict or liberal. And I think NetNewsWire will help Atom become popular.</p>

<p>What I’d like to see is a commitment to well-formed XML on the part of everybody that has anything to do with Atom. Atom has the chance to set a high standard, not just as a good spec but as good-in-practice. I bet Mark agrees with me on this.
