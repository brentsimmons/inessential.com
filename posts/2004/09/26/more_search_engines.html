NetNewsWireâ€™s <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/features/searchEngineSubscriptions.php">search engine subscriptions</a> feature works with <a href="http://blogdigger.com/">Blogdigger</a>, <a href="http://www.daypop.com/">Daypop</a>, and <a href="http://www.feedster.com/">Feedster</a>.</p>

<p>These search engines work with NetNewsWire because they return feeds (RSS, in this case) that NetNewsWire can read. Are there other search engines that return RSS or Atom feeds? It would be cool to add more.
