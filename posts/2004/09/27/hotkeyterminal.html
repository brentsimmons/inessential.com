Some Mac developers I talk to like doing little hacks, they like programming little customize-the-system stuff.</p>

<p>I understand this: itâ€™s cool, fun, relaxing, a nice way to take a break from the bigger problems of working on an application.</p>

<p>But I myself almost never do this kind of thing. Except recently I did.</p>

<p>I wanted a global keyboard shortcut for launching Terminal or bringing it to the front. I could have chosen from any number of launchers and utilities that make this possible, but I realized I just wanted this one, simple thingâ€”so I wrote HotKeyTerminal which does this one simple thing.</p>

<p>It runs in the background (no dock icon). I made it a startup item so itâ€™s always there. And now whenever I hit cmd-escape, Terminal comes to the front.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s an excellent chance you donâ€™t need this, since it was really just written for me. Itâ€™s not an official Ranchero Software release, itâ€™s completely unsupportedâ€”Iâ€™ll probably never mention it again. But you can download the <a href="http://ranchero.com/downloads/hotkeyterminal.tar.gz">app</a> or the (extremely simple) <a href="http://ranchero.com/downloads/hotkeyterminalsource.tar.gz">source</a>.
