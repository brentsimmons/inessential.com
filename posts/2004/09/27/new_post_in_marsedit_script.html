We’ve had a few feature requests for this scenario:</p>

<p>1. You’re in NetNewsWire.</p>

<p>2. You want to start a new, empty post in MarsEdit. (You don’t want to post the item you’re reading, in other words—you want a fresh new post window.)</p>

<p>In NetNewsWire 1.x, you could choose a switch-to-weblog-editor command. But that command doesn’t exist anymore.</p>

<p>Solution: put a script in NetNewsWire’s scripts menu that does that. (You can <a href="http://ranchero.com/downloads/NewPostInMarsEdit.zip">download</a> this one, if you like.)</p>

<p>Here’s what to do:</p>

<p>1. Download the script and unzip it.</p>

<p>2. In NetNewsWire, choose Open Scripts Folder from the scripts menu.</p>

<p>3. Drop the unzipped script in the scripts folder.</p>

<p>4. Back in NetNewsWire, pull down the scripts menu—you should see a New Post in MarsEdit command. (If you don’t see it, wait a few seconds for NetNewsWire to notice it, then pull down the menu again.)</p>

<p>5. Choose the command—it will bring MarsEdit to the front, launching it if necessary, and create a new, empty post window.</p>

<p>I haven’t tried a similar thing for ecto, Blapp, Xjournal, and others—but I imagine that similar scripts for other weblog editors are just as easy to write.
