For a little while, in an earlier test version, we had embedded <a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/">HTML Tidy</a> in NetNewsWire. We ended up not needing itâ€”but I still want to say how cool HTML Tidy is.</p>

<p>The thing was, we needed a way to create valid XHTML. I knew about HTML Tidy, but I expected it would use the GPL license, and so we wouldn’t be able to use it.</p>

<p>I went and checked it out anywayâ€”just in case, on the long shot that it was cool to use itâ€”and, to my surprise, it was.</p>

<p>But then we also needed it to be easy-to-use. I didn’t want to spend hours learning some complicated API, I wanted something easy, where I could say: â€œHere’s some tag soup. Please give me back some valid XHTML.â€</p>

<p>To my delight, that’s pretty much how it worked. Very easy.</p>

<p>The last thing we had to worry about was performance. Was it fast? Yes, it was. I couldn’t perceive a difference between when it was on and when it was off. (Of course, timing tests would show the difference, but a user would never have noticed it.)</p>

<p>So, to the HTML Tidy folksâ€”even though I didn’t end up needing itâ€”I present a small bouquet of &lt;flowers /&gt;.
