Somehow I made it to the advanced age of __ without ever having made a slide show. Iâ€™ve never actually used PowerPoint or anything like that.</p>

<p>I just installed <a href="http://www.apple.com/keynote/">Keynote</a> so I can create slides for my presentation at the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/macosx2004/">OS X conference</a>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve seen a bunch of slide show presentations, and Iâ€™ve sometimes thought, â€œHey, I could do better than this.â€ But now I have to actually do it.</p>

<p>The topic is embedded HTML/browsing and the user interface challenges it brings up. Some of it comes from the experience I had bringing browsing to NetNewsWire, but it will also look at other apps (other newsreaders, iTunes Music Store, mail apps, weblog editors, text editors, and so on).</p>

<p>(Ironically, my favorite example of embedded HTML is <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/mailsmith/index.shtml">Mailsmith</a>. It just doesnâ€™t do it. And thatâ€™s one of the big reasons I use it. For me, itâ€™s 99% true that if itâ€™s HTML email, itâ€™s spam. That wonâ€™t be true for everybody, of course.)</p>

<p>If you have any commentsâ€”such as that you love <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEditâ€™s</a> HTML preview because <i>x</i> or you think NetNewsWireâ€™s browser would be better if <i>y</i> or you wish the iTunes Music Store also did <i>z</i>â€”Iâ€™d love to hear about it. Put on your user interface hat.</p>

<p>To be clear, the topic is not browsers, itâ€™s everything that displays HTML except for browsers.
