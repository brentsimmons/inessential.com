So—how is the Bloglines integration going to work in NetNewsWire?</p>

<p>I don’t know all the details yet, but there are a few important things I can say right away:</p>

<p>1. It’s not forced on anybody. It will be an option that you can turn on.</p>

<p>2. If you use it, you won’t have to use it for all your subscriptions. You can use it for just a subset if you want to.</p>

<p>3. There will also be other means of syncing in 2.0.</p>

<p>4. We continue to look at other bandwidth solutions too. (For instance: in the <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=2922">comments</a> for my previous post, Jens Alfke mentioned Jabber/XMPP, which sounds pretty cool.)</p>

<p>Anyway, the scoop is, it will be there for people who want it—and I’m already getting feedback on this, so I sense that there are lots of people who want it.

<h4>User interface</h4>
<p>
The UI in NetNewsWire hasn’t been worked out yet.</p>

<p>I note that what FeedDemon does is to have a special <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/help/1.0/bloglines/synching.asp">Bloglines Channel Group</a>. We may do something similar—because there’s something to be said for a consistent UI even across apps on different platforms, and also because it’s straightforward and explicit.</p>

<p>The equivalent in NetNewsWire would be a special Bloglines folder which contains your Bloglines-managed subscriptions.</p>

<p>Another option would be to allow you to have Bloglines-managed subscriptions interspersed with the rest of your subscriptions—but that might lead to some confusion. I’m leaning toward Nick’s approach.</p>

<p>But feedback is very welcome—post comments here or send me email. Thanks!
