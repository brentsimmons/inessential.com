As you might imagine, we’ve had a ton of email since releasing the NetNewsWire public beta yesterday. A few things have come up more than once, so I thought I’d answer them here.
</p><h4>What happened to the Mark All as Read toolbar button?</h4><p>
It’s still there—choose Customize Toolbar from the View menu to add it. (There are some other toolbar items might want to add, such as Post to Weblog and Mark as Flagged.)
</p><h4>The Find command doesn’t work!</h4><p>
Yes, it’s broken at the moment. It will get fixed before 2.0 ships.
</p><h4>What’s the best place to report a bug? How should I make feature requests?</h4><p>The answer to both is the on-line bug tracker. You can report bugs and make feature requests from the same form. Choose Report a Bug from the Help menu.
</p><h4>How can I open browser tabs in the background?</h4><p>
Open NetNewsWire’s preferences, click on the Browsing icon, then un-check the box next to “Select new tabs as they are created.”
</p><h4>Is the pricing just a special sale?</h4><p>
It’s not a special sale. NetNewsWire 2.0 is $24.95 or $39.95 bundled with MarsEdit. Those are the regular prices.
</p><h4>How can I read restricted LiveJournal feeds?</h4><p>
Instructions are in the Help book—choose NetNewsWire Help from the Help menu then click on Questions & Answers. The question about LiveJournal is the top item.</p>

<p>Note: we realize that Help viewer used to be so painfully slow that we’ve all become unaccustomed to using it. But it’s pretty fast in 10.3, and NetNewsWire’s help actually has a bunch of info. Also see the Tips page in the Help book.
</p><h4>Is there an alternative to the Yahoo Groups mailing list?</h4><p>Yes—we’re transitioning away from the Yahoo Groups mailing list to a new one (generously hosted by Aaron Swartz). List instructions are on the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php">beta-download page</a>.
