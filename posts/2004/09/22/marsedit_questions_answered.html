A few common questions about MarsEdit have come up since the public beta...
</p>
<h4>Why can’t I set titles for Blogger posts?</h4>
<p>
Unfortunately, the Blogger API doesn’t support titles, even though you can enter titles through Blogger’s web interface.</p>

<p>On the bright side, once we add support for the Atom editing API, then it should be possible to use titles with Blogger posts.
</p>
<h4>When will MarsEdit support the Atom editing API?</h4>
<p>
It won’t happen for 1.0—for 1.0 the plan is to fix bugs and add polish, but not make any big changes from what you see now.</p>

<p>But support for the Atom editing API is a huge priority for after 1.0.
</p>
<h4>How come I can’t upload images to my WordPress weblog?</h4>
<p>
Once the WordPress folks add support for the image-uploading part of the MetaWeblog API, it will work. (They’re a hard-working bunch: I expect it won’t take long.)
</p>
<h4>How do I set a category in Blosxom?</h4>
<p>
You’ll need to add the category popup menu to the toolbar. With a document window in front, choose Customize Toolbar from the View menu, and drag the category popup menu into the toolbar. Then you’ll be able to set categories.
</p>
<h4>How do I use MarsEdit with my web browser?</h4>
<p>
From the MarsEdit menu, choose Install Bookmarklet. You’ll then be able to send a page from your browser to MarsEdit in much the way you can send news items from your newsreader.
</p>
<h4>When will you add _______?</h4>
<p>
It’s hard to say—so I think I’ll distract you by saying, “Hey, did you notice the Edit with BBEdit and Edit with SubEthaEdit commands in the File menu?”
