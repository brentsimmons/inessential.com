A few people have sent me email with ideas on competing with <a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/">ecto</a>. Here’s the thing, though: I like Adriaan a lot and I think ecto is cool.</p>

<p>The same goes for other weblog editors and their developers: <a href="http://blapp.sourceforge.net/">Blapp</a> is cool, <a href="http://www.speirs.org/xjournal/">Xjournal</a> is cool, and I like <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/blog/">Michael</a> and <a href="http://www.speirs.org/">Fraser</a>. <a href="http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/">Daniel Berlinger</a> does a great job with <a href="http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/downloads">Archipelago</a> (a Manila editor)—and Daniel and I go waaaay back.</p>

<p>In fact, I was sad to read that <a href="http://www.interalia.org/">Phil Ulrich</a> isn’t continuing <a href="http://interalia.org/archives/2004/09/18/do-it-yourself-userspace-kit#more-3967">Userspace</a> development, because it sounded really good and I like Phil.</p>

<p>One of the luxuries of running your own business that Sheila and I enjoy is that we are allowed to make decisions that go against common business wisdom. We could have made the NetNewsWire-MarsEdit connection proprietary, but that would have been, well, <i>mean</i>.</p>

<p>When NetNewsWire talks to MarsEdit, it uses the exact same API, the exact same code, it uses to talk to ecto, <a href="http://www.scifihifi.com/cocoalicious/">Cocoal.icio.us</a> (by master of ceremonies Buzz Andersen), and other software.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s weird or naive of me, but I <i>like</i> other OS X weblog editor developers. It’s a great group of people. And so I find myself rooting for their success, even when we have products in the same space. And I also find that I really like this situation.</p>

<p>But—more about the weblog editor space—I think the number of people who have already bought a weblog editor is very, very small compared to the number of people who <i>will</i> buy a weblog editor. It’s only just this year that weblog editors are starting to become software you’d want to use day-to-day. (In other words, the success of one editor doesn’t preclude success of another.)</p>

<p>So, it’s not as if different weblog editors don’t compete. Sure they do. But I’m totally not into playing any hardball here: that would suck the fun out of it for me. I think of the competition as being very friendly—but if it gives us all a bit of incentive to work hard and make our software better, that’s cool.</p>

<p>At the same time—and more importantly—we’re all collaborating on showing that weblog editors are getting ready for prime time.
