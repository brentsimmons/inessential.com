You know whenever people post screenshots of emulators, how it can be weird to see Windows running on a Mac? (Even weirder if you actually use an emulator, until you get used to it.)</p>

<p>Here’s a similar side effect of having embedded a browser in NetNewsWire. (Click for full-size screen shots.)</p>

<p>Even though it’s odd, there’s actually a point to itâ€”we discovered that some people use multiple aggregators. One for fun stuff and one for work, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>If one is browser-based and the other embeds a browser, then, well, hey, you’ve got something like the above.
