<p>NetNewsWire 2.0b3—full and Lite versions—are now in public beta.</p>

<p>Here’s <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/whatsnew/netnewswire20.php">what’s new in 2.0</a> and here’s the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php">download page</a>.</p>

<p>If you bought (or will buy) any version of NetNewsWire 1.x, all NetNewsWire 2.x upgrades are free.</p>

<p>Here are a few screenshots of NetNewsWire 2.0: <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/iPodSmartList.png">setting up a smart list</a>, <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/newSearchSubscription.png">creating a new search engine subscription</a>, <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/tabbedBrowser.png">using the new embedded tabbed browser</a>, <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/severalStyles.png">a collection of built-in styles</a>, and <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/activityWindow.jpg">the activity window</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://ranchero.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>, our new weblog editor, is also in public beta: it’s designed to make weblog writing like writing email.</p>

<p>If you bought (or will buy) any version of NetNewsWire 1.x, all MarsEdit 1.x upgrades are free too. In other words, if you already bought NetNewsWire, you own a license for MarsEdit.</p>

<p>Here’s a <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/postToWeblogMars.png">screen shot</a> that shows both NetNewsWire and MarsEdit—the Post-to-weblog button has been clicked in NetNewsWire, and the post has opened in a new window in MarsEdit. (More screen shots appear on the MarsEdit <a href="http://ranchero.com/marsedit/">home page</a>.)</p>

<p>So, what’s the deal?</p>

<p>We get so many great feature requests, and we wanted to add a bunch of new features to NetNewsWire. But we realized there wasn’t really <i>room</i> to add features to the newsreader and the weblog editor both unless they were split into separate applications.</p>

<p>NetNewsWire’s new features including searching, flagged items, persistence, per-feed refresh settings, new icons by Bryan Bell and Jon Hicks, embedded browser, smart lists, search engine subscriptions, script subscriptions—and <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire20.php">more</a>. The weblog editor was removed completely.</p>

<p>MarsEdit was more of a from-scratch application. We kept (but revised) some of the under-the-hood plumbing that was in NetNewsWire’s weblog editor, but then we completely re-designed the user interface to make it work more like email. There’s a main window that lists your weblog and recent posts, and you create and edit posts in separate windows—just like using an email program.</p>

<p>Another thing we wanted to do was make it possible to mix and match newsreaders and weblog editors. See the page on NetNewsWire and <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/features/externalEditors.php">external weblog editors</a>.</p>

<p>We also wanted to make it so NetNewsWire Lite users could have a Post-to-Weblog button—and now they do. When it comes to weblog editing, there is no difference between NetNewsWire and NetNewsWire Lite.
