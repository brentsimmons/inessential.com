Iâ€™ve been using CVS for a long timeâ€”and sometimes I feel like Gus Mueller (now <a href="http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2004/9/19.html#1135">married</a>!) when he wrote the immortal line <a href="http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2004/9/15.html#1132">Die CVS die</a>.</p>

<p>One itemâ€”MacDevCenter on <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/08/10/subversion.html">Making the Jump to Subversion</a>â€”has been staring at me every day since August. I canâ€™t actually make the jump until after finishing the NetNewsWire and MarsEdit releases, but I sure am eager.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve heard from reliable sources that not only does Subversion solve some of the annoyances with CVS, it also makes peppers taste hotter and the sun shine brighter.
