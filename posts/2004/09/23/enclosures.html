We almost didnâ€™t add <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/features/enclosures.php">support for enclosures</a> to NetNewsWire 2.0â€”because they give me the willies. Experts have assured me that my fear of enclosures is irrational and paranoid, and so we went ahead and added support.</p>

<p>We didnâ€™t do the download-enclosures-at-night feature that <a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio UserLand</a> hasâ€”enclosures are only downloaded when you click on them.</p>

<p>But we did something else: we added AppleScript support for enclosures. You could write a script that gets the enclosure info from your news items and then downloads the enclosuresâ€”so you could write a script that downloads at night. Or on your lunch break. Or that just downloads mp3s, or whatever.</p>

<p>My hope is that somebody will take this as an opportunity to do something cool and write an enclosure-downloading script (perhaps an AppleScript Studio app?) that other folks can use.
