There’s a new discount for attending the Mac OS X conference <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5646">for ADC Members and Apple Employees</a>. It even includes the free ADC members.</p>

<p>I’ll be at the conference myself, on a panel talking about <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/macosx2004/view/e_sess/5685">running a small software business</a> and giving a talk about the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/macosx2004/view/e_sess/5721">UI challenges</a> that come up when you add HTML and browsing to your application.
