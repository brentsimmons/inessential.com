Hereâ€™s Bryan Bell on designing the <a href="http://www.bryanbell.com/2004/09/24#a1151">MarsEdit And NetNewsWire icons</a>. His post includes some versions of the app icons that I myself never saw.</p>

<p>Also see <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/579/netnewswire-2">Jon Hicks</a> on designing icons for NetNewsWire (including a hack I mentioned previously for switching to the all-Jon-Hicks set).
