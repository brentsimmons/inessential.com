The MacZealots folks have posted a tutorial: <a href="http://maczealots.com/tutorials/xcode-svn/">Using Subversion With XCode</a>. Right on.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=2908">comments</a> for yesterday’s post about Subversion, Kevin Ballard asked why I’m waiting for NetNewsWire and MarsEdit to ship before I make the switch. Excellent question. The answer is simply that when I’m in the last phase of a project I like to be as conservative as I can. The mindset I have when I’m fixing bugs and adding polish is not compatible with making big infrastructure changes. (You ever watch the TV show <a href="http://www.usanetwork.com/series/monk/">Monk</a>? This is the Monk phase of the project.)</p>

<p>I’m not saying that’s a rule all developers should follow—just that it works for me.
