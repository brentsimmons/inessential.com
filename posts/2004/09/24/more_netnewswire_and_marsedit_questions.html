Some more answers to common questions about NetNewsWire and MarsEdit...
</p>
<h4>Can I use SSL?</h4>
<p>
Yes. It should work in both NetNewsWire and MarsEdit. However, if you have a self-signed certificate, youâ€™ll need to follow this <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/comment.php?mode=display&sid=20031023144031331&title=10.3%3A+Importing+self-signed+SSL+certificates&type=article&order=&pid=29459">hint</a> on MacOSXHints to get it to work.
</p>
<h4>Can NetNewsWireâ€™s browser display Flash and other plugins?</h4>
<p>Yes. Hereâ€™ how:</p>

<p>1. Open NetNewsWireâ€™s preferences window and click the HTML icon.</p>

<p>2. In the popup menu at the top, choose â€œNews Item Descriptionsâ€ if itâ€™s not selected.</p>

<p>3. Make sure the box next to â€œEnable plug-insâ€ is checked.</p>

<p>4. Go back to the popup menu at the top and choose â€œExternal Pages,â€ and make sure the box next to â€œEnable plug-insâ€ is checked.</p>

<p>The weird thing is that for plugins to work for external pages you have to have plugins enabled for news item descriptions. (I suspect this is due to a WebKit bug, but Iâ€™m not positive yet. Iâ€™ll report it to Apple once Iâ€™m sure this is the case.)
</p>
<h4>How do I set the primary category in MarsEdit?</h4>
<p>
You set the primary category via the category popup menu. With a document window open, choose View > Customize Toolbar to add the popup menu.</p>

<p>If you think that this should be made easier, Iâ€™d agree with you completely.
</p>
<h4>How come MarsEdit canâ€™t [set post status to published, upload images, etc.] with WordPress?</h4>
<p>
The WordPress folks are working on making sure WordPress works better with external weblog editors. Theyâ€™re doing a good job, and I think WordPress 1.3 is going to be cool.</p>

<p>In the meantime, one thing you can do is try Johann Richardâ€™s <a href="http://mycvs.org/archives/2004/08/22/combined-xml-rpc-patch-for-wordpress-12-and-ecto/">Combined XML-RPC Patch for WordPress 1.2 and Ecto or MarsEdit</a>. (But note that itâ€™s at your own risk: we canâ€™t help you with your WordPress installation, since weâ€™re working on NetNewsWire and MarsEdit.)
</p>
<h4>Are you looking for more styles to include with NetNewsWire?</h4>
<p>
You bet! If you make one, and youâ€™d like to submit it for possible inclusion, just stuff it or zip it and send it to me via email. We canâ€™t guarantee that weâ€™ll include every one we get, of course, but weâ€™ll strongly consider every one. (And if we include it then you will be credited in the About box. I think youâ€™ll find that the WordPress community is quite helpful, though.)</p>

<p>Some of the things we look at:</p>

<p>1. Is it different from the other styles?</p>

<p>2. Does it work with all three layouts (traditional, widescreen, and Combined View)?</p>

<p>3. Does it work with items that have very long titles?</p>

<p>4. Does it work if I make my NetNewsWire window small? Or large?</p>

<p><h4>Can I pay via PayPal?</h4>
<p>Yes. Hereâ€™s how:</p>

<p>1. Go to the regular Kagi <a href="https://order.kagi.com/cgi-bin/store.cgi?storeID=2DQ">store page</a> and decide what you want and look up the price.</p>

<p>2. Go to the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire home page</a>, scroll to the bottom, and click on the PayPal Donate button.</p>

<p>3. Then <a href="mailto:info@ranchero.com">send us an email</a> letting us know that you paid via PayPal and what product you bought. Weâ€™ll email you your serial number(s).</p>
