So—I had signed up for <a href="http://rss.meetup.com/">RSS Meetups</a>, and then I got an email asking me to vote on a venue.</p>

<p>Then I checked, and found that I was the only Seattle-ite who had signed up, so I made my decision. The meetup will be held wherever I happen to be at the scheduled time, and everybody (me) will be in attendance, and we don’t have to talk about RSS if we don’t feel like it.</p>

<p>In fact, if we just want to watch TV, or play with the cat, or do some coding—that’s all fine.
