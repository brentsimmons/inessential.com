There’s a <a href="http://www.macdeveloperjournal.com/issue2/interview.html">video interview with me</a> in the latest Mac Developer Journal. Jason Snell interviewed me via iSight.</p>

<p>(I haven’t watched it yet, because I’m not used to looking at myself on video. I figure it’s a lot like when you hear your voice on tape—only ten times worse.)</p>

<p>This is a use of iSight I hadn’t thought of when the iSight first came out. I wonder if it will catch on—will journalists interview more developers this way? I have to say that I enjoyed it, and I’d do it again.</p>

<p>By the way, this wasn’t the first time I was interviewed via iSight, but it’s the first time it was recorded so people could watch it later.
