<a href="http://noggs.typepad.com/the_reading_experience/2004/03/i_have_tried_to.html">The Reading Experience</a>: “There are lots—lots—of purportedly ‘cultural’ blogs that also offer up plenty of political rhetoric, but few, at least in my reading, that simply examine art, literature, and culture as if they were pursuits with value separate from ongoing political discourse.”</p>

<p>This is a subject near to my heart. It’s sad how people so often write about literature through political-ideology-colored glasses.</p>

<p>(In an alternate universe, inessential.com is a weblog about books. In fact, the name “inessential” refers to literature.)
