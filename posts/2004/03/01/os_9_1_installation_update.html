Thanks for all the help the other day with my question about upgrading to OS 9.1 on a machine with a broken CD drive.</p>

<p>As a couple people mentioned, it turned out I just could just download the update and install it without having to boot from a CD or other external drive. It worked! Problem solved. Thanks!
