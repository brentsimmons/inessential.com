<p>The irony of being at a computer conference with all this wonderful technology is that it’s just about impossible to connect to the Internet.</p>

<p>I was able to get on earlier today for just enough time to post to my weblog—and now, many hours later, I’m at a nearby Starbuck’s, since it’s the only place that seems to have working Internet.</p>

<p>I haven’t been able to check my email since Saturday. (There’s a ton! It’s downloading now...)</p>

<p>Anyway, there’s a good chance the networking situation will be better tomorrow. As I recall, last year it was worst on the first day, then after that it was better.</p>
