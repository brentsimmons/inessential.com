I just saw for the first time a feed with the filename <code>rss.xml</code> that’s actually an Atom feed.</p>

<p>That won’t confuse NetNewsWire (which doesn’t care about the filename when determining which parser to use)—but it could be confusing to, well, people.</p>

<p>I’m not going to link to it, because I don’t want to embarrass anybody, but I do want to point it out in case this is the first data point in a trend. (Heck, maybe there are thousands of these already, and this is just the first one I’ve noticed.)</p>

<p>My concern is that the term <code>RSS</code> could come to mean syndication-in-general, including Atom. I don’t think advocates of Atom or of RSS want that to happen. (Though I could be wrong.)
