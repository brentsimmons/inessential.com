<p>If you’re at WWDC, and you’re interested in RSS, please come by the RSS <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/community.html#bofs">Birds of a Feather</a> discussion tonight.</p>

<p>It’s at 7:30 p.m. in Community 2, Level 2. It’s moderated by Fraser Speirs, and I’ll be on the panel along with Michael McCracken and Steven Frank.</p>

<p>(It’s possible that after the BoF we’ll have to go get some beers.)</p>
