Sheila and I saw David Bowie at the Key Arena last night. He was great, the band rocked—and Sheila and I both have “All the Young Dudes” stuck in our head.</p>

<p>Pure magic. Easily one of the best shows I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>The P-I has a <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/pop/169223_bowie15ww.html">review</a> and <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/photos/popup.asp?gtitle=David%20Bowie%20and%20the%20Polyphonic%20Spree&SubID=741&page=0&css=gtitle.css&pubdate=04/15/04">photos</a>.
