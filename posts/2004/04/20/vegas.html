Sheila and I got back last night from a four-day weekend in Las Vegas. We went with some family and friends, stayed at the Paris hotel, had a wonderful time.</p>

<p>Right before we left, we noted the announcement of <a href="http://nslog.com/archives/2004/04/15/pulpfiction.php">PulpFiction</a>. You know what? It looks pretty good.</p>

<p>Only a masochist craves competition—but quality competition is a sign of a healthy ecosystem.</p>

<p>At any rate, it’s probably a good idea if I talk more about what’s coming in the next release of NetNewsWire. Which I’ll do, in a follow-up post.
