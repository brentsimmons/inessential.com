Here’s something I don’t understand: why are sort indicators in OS X backwards? Consider this screen shot:</p>

<p><img src="http://inessential.com/images/sortIndicator.png" width="249" height="239" alt="sort indicator screenshot" /></p>

<p>The column is sorted alphabetically, from A down to Z, yet the sort indicator arrow points up instead of down. I would expect it to indicate the direction of the sort, but it indicates the <i>opposite</i> of the sort direction. (Or so it seems to me.)</p>

<p>I’m sure there’s an explanation. But what is it?
