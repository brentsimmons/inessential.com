Remember how the other day I was picking on Yahoo because its search feeds had non-unique unique IDs?</p>

<p>Now today I notice that the bug has been fixed. (They also switched to using RSS 2.0.) Here’s the <a href="http://search.news.yahoo.com/usns/ynsearch/categories/47/index.html?p=apple">feed</a> I was looking at in my previous post.</p>

<p>Thanks! Good job!</p>

<p>Now I can add Yahoo to the list of search engine feed providers in NetNewsWire, which is something folks have been asking for, and I’m glad to be able to do.
