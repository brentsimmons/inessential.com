“I moved to Dallas-Fort Worth to improve my future. So should you.”<br />
-Alex Rodriguez, March 2001, in a letter to Boeing executives</p>

<p>It may be that there’s a curse of A-Rod—that he himself is cursed, self-cursed—and that, by <i>not</i> getting him, the Red Sox removed the curse of the Bambino. (Call it ironic symmetry.)</p>

<p> I can’t help but notice that <i>losing</i> A-Rod has a powerfully good effect on a team’s won-loss record. Just look at the Mariners 116 wins in 2001 and the Rangers 89 wins this year.</p>

<p>It may be that the Yankees, in order to win the World Series again, may need to deal A-Rod to another team.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I could be totally nuts. Baseball is tricky, and baseball karma is a mysterious thing.
