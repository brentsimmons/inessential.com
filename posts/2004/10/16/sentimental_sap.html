Science fiction brings out the sentimental sap in me.</p>

<p>I was watching a TV show last night. The folks on the ship had been away from Earth—lost in space <i>and</i> time—fighting the bad guys. Things looked bleak. Except when they looked worse than bleak.</p>

<p>But somehow—with heart and brains, sheer pluck, and the aid of crack Hollywood scriptwriters—they triumphed!</p>

<p>As the ship returns to Earth they see it in the viewscreen. Big and blue and beautiful, it looks like home.</p>

<p>But they’re not sure it’s <i>their</i> Earth in <i>their</i> time yet, until the radio operator says, “Lunar Colony One, orbital platforms, San Francisco—they’re all calling in, sir.”</p>

<p>And, no exaggeration, my eyes well up with water.</p>

<p>Don’t <i>even</i> try to watch Blade Runner with me. I lose it at the end when Roy Baty deactivates. Every time.
