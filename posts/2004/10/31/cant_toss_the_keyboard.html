I have an old Apple Extended keyboard in my office closet. I can’t throw it away—it’s so much better than any other keyboard I’ve ever used.</p>

<p>But it’s ADB, not USB, so I can’t use it without an adapter—and I’ve read enough to know that using an ADB adapter with one of those old keyboards has enough problems to make it a bad idea.</p>

<p>So today I ordered a <a href="http://matias.ca/tactilepro/index.php">Matias Tactile Pro keyboard</a>. I’m <i>so</i> looking forward its arrival.</p>

<p>But I still can’t toss the old Apple Extended keyboard. I’m no packrat—quite the opposite—but that old keyboard was quite the thing of beauty. I just went and pressed some of its keys. Still sweet.</p>

<p>If you make your living by typing, you know what I’m talking about. A great keyboard inspires great affection.
