Noticed in my referers: Darrel E. Knutson’s list of <a href="http://darrel.knutson.com/mac/www/browsers.html">Macintosh Web Browsers</a>.</p>

<p>Lots of them I’d never heard of, but some of them—NCSA Mosaic, MacWeb, CyberDog, Spyglass—I remember using.</p>

<p>NCSA Mosaic, even though it lacked the features of Netscape 1.0, was probably my favorite.</p>

<p>I was never that big a fan of OpenDoc, or else I might have liked CyberDog more.</p>

<p>But the first web browser I ever used was Lynx. My Internet connection was by dialing into Eskimo, a local ISP. (I used <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dalverson/zterm/">ZTerm</a> to dial in. I think.) You got a UNIX shell account, so you could run lynx and pine and whatever.</p>

<p>I remember, at the time (1994), debating with people which would be bigger: Gopher or the World Wide Web. I thought it would be the web. But I did like Gopher quite a bit.</p>

<p>And I still like Lynx. I even use it sometimes.
