<a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2004/10/how_to_run_your.html">Niall Kennedy</a> posted an audio file of the How to Run your Own Software Business panel at the OS X conference.</p>

<p>When talking about getting started as an OS X developer, certain subjects often get more time than they need: dealing with piracy and legal issues get an unrepresentative amount of time. (Maybe because these are easy to talk about?) If you’re a developer, you spend more time working on your software than you do anything else. Then there are other very important issues such as customer support, marketing, figuring out pricing, building a website, and so on.</p>

<p>If worrying that your software will get cracked prevents you from taking the plunge, don’t worry. Your software <i>will</i> get cracked. But you can have a successful business anyway.</p>

<p>(If your software <i>doesn’t</i> get cracked, then that’s probably something to worry about. It means you either spent way too much time making it uncrackable—or it wasn’t interesting enough to crack.)</p>

<p>A panel is too short to talk about everything, so (when I have time) I’ll elaborate on some of what was said and mention some things that didn’t get covered.
