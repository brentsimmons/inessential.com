<p>Here are the <a href="http://ranchero.com/marsedit/changenotes/1.0b4.php">change notes</a>.</p>

<p>The goal of this release was to fix a couple high-priority bugs: 1) the bug with applying default settings when you choose post-to-weblog in another app and 2) sending trackbacks.</p>

<p>Some of you are eager for Markdown preview support and for customizing the list of sites to ping. Both of those features are still on the to-do list for 1.0, but they’re not in this beta.</p>

<p>WordPress is kind of a special case, since its external weblog editor support is a work-in-progress. (Make no mistake: I think WordPress is fantastic software, and I recognize that they’re working on fixing bugs with external editor support.)</p>

<p>So when we say that you can send trackbacks now, I’m not actually sure that it works with WordPress yet. It mightâ€”or, it might work with some versions and not others.
