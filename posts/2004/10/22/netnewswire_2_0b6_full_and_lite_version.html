<p>We posted new betas of NetNewsWire (full and Lite versions) to the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php">beta page</a>.</p>

<p>The main goals of this release were to fix some important bugs—including crashing bugs, a memory-use bug, and the demo-expiration bug—and to make the Find panel work.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire2.0b6.php">change notes</a> to see what’s changed since the previous beta.</p>

<p>We’re continuing to work on other new features and bug fixes, of course—there will be more betas. So if a feature you’re waiting for isn’t there yet, or if a bug you reported hasn’t been fixed, worry not—we’re still at work.</p>

<p>The Find panel seems like a little thing, but it’s an important feature. In NetNewsWire 1.x, the Find panel was what we had instead of searching. It searched through all your headlines. Now that we have searching in the toolbar, the Find panel can be a more traditional Find panel—it does a search in whatever has focus.</p>

<p>This means that, for the first time in NetNewsWire, you can do a find in your Subscriptions list, in news item descriptions, in web pages, and in the Sites Drawer.
