Damien Barrett, Dori Smith, and Tom Negrino are hosting a <a href="http://www.mrbarrett.com/mt/archives/2004_10_14.html#001034">blogger get-together</a> at the OS X conference a week from today. “Everyone is welcome. You don’t have to be a blogger to come hang with us! We’ll likely be piling into vehicles and going for a late dinner and drinks.”</p>

<p>I’ll be there—it sounds like fun.
