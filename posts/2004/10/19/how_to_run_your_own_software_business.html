Next Tuesday at the OS X Conference I’ll be on a panel that Dan Wood put together: <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5737">How to run your own software business</a>.</p>

<p>One of the great things about running a small, independent software business is that it takes so little investment to get going. You need some computers—which I bet you already have. The developer tools are free. You need a website and email accounts and internet access, all of which are fairly inexpensive.</p>

<p>Depending on your goals, you don’t necessarily need to hire employees or rent an office or any of that traditional business stuff. The overhead is <i>low</i>, absurdly low.</p>

<p>But that doesn’t mean it’s a piece of cake. You still have to create a product that people will like, and then you have to deal with paying taxes, keeping records, finding a payment processor, creating a website, helping customers—and a million details. It’s no slam-dunk, for sure.</p>

<p>It’s possible to succeed, and it’s possible to fail—but, the more you know, the better your chances of success.
