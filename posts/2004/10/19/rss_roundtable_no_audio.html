I’ve had some queries about an audio file of the <a href="http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000337.html">RSS Roundtable</a> interview. The interview was, however, conducted via email.</p>

<p>I’m not sure you could have gotten everyone to agree with any other method. Email is useful as a common denominator with things like this.
