Wolfgang Bartelme posted an <a href="http://interfacelift.com/icons-mac/details.php?id=1303">alternate NetNewsWire app icon</a>. Veerle Pieters was I think the first to post <a href="http://veerle.duoh.com/comments.php?id=250_0_2_0_C#comments">alternate icons</a>—and she includes instructions on how to replace the current icon.</p>

<p>There may be a business case to make for <i>not</i> linking to these, for saying, “Hey, this is our look, don’t mess with it”—but actually I think it’s quite cool that people would make alternate icons.</p>

<p>While I totally dig Bryan’s icons, not everybody has the same taste, and an icon that looks good on one display in one person’s Dock will look different elsewhere. No problem.
