<p>It may seem like a small story—but I don’t think it is. My hope is that private space flight means we’re for real this time, we aren’t just tip-toeing.</p>

<p>I love NASA, but, for whatever reasons, they’ve been soooo slooow. As a boy in the ’70s I thought for sure we’d be on Mars by now. I thought we’d have a lunar colony. By the year 2000? Heck yeah, it was a cinch.</p>

<p>And then the Apollo missions ended, and then we got the space shuttle—which was never nearly as inexpensive and safe as it was supposed to be—and it looked like we lost interest in space.</p>

<p>But today is a new start.
