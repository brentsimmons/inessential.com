Gus Mueller has VoodooPad working as an <a href="http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2004/10/17.html#1143">external editor</a> for NetNewsWireâ€”plus a script that sends a URL from NetNewsWire to VoodooPad so you can save it for reading later.</p>

<p>I <i>love</i> stuff like this. I love it when apps work together to create personalized systems that are greater than the sum of their parts.
