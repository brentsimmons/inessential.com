O’Reilly’s <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/macosx2004/">Mac OS X Conference</a> starts Monday. See you there?</p>

<p>In case you’re going, but haven’t been to a conference like this before, here’s a tip: turn on iChat and log into Rendezvous. It’s a great way to find people you’d like to meet. You see that so-and-so is logged in, so you say, “Hey! I’d like to meet you—where are you?” It works.</p>

<p>Update 11:23 p.m.: <a href="http://www.backupbrain.com/2004_10_24_archive.html#a004232">Dori Smith elaborates</a> on iChat privacy settings and adds a bonus tip about using SubEthaEdit.
