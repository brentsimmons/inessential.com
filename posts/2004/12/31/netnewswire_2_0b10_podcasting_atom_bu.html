<p><a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php">NetNewsWire 2.0b10</a> includes bug fixes, a rewritten Atom parser, a bunch of small new features and enhancements—but the feature that will probably get the most attention is podcasting support.</p>

<p>Note: it’s still a beta. It still has bugs. In fact, one of the changes we made was that, the first time you launch it, a window appears that reminds you it’s a beta.</p>

<p>Some of the changes you were waiting for—they’re in there now. Some things you’re waiting for aren’t there yet—but we’re working on them!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire2.0b10.php">change notes</a> go into more detail.

<h4>Screen shots</h4>

Before talking more about podcasting, here are a few screen shots, since the look of things has changed a little bit since the previous beta:</p>

<h4>Podcasting</h4>
<p>We weren’t originally going to add podcasting support to NetNewsWire 2.0—but after intense lobbying by a thousand and one podcast enthusiasts, we changed our mind.</p>

<p>Here’s the gist of how it works:</p>

<p>1. Whenever there’s a news item with an enclosure, NetNewsWire tells you, and gives you buttons you can click to download it to disk or to iTunes.</p>

<p>2. You can tell NetNewsWire to download enclosures automatically or not.</p>

<p>3. You can tell NetNewsWire to send audio enclosures to iTunes. You can tell it to use the name of the feed as the playlist name, or you can specify a playlist name. You can also specify a genre and you can tell NetNewsWire to delete downloaded files after sending them to iTunes.</p>

<p>4. You can create a smart list that shows all your enclosures.</p>

<p>(See some of the screen shots further up to see what all this looks like.)</p>

<p>This is all still beta, of course—there may be bugs, and the feature may still evolve based on feedback.

<h4>More features</h4>

There are a bunch of other cool things I want to point out—but I’ll save them for follow-up posts...
