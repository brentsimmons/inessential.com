The Atom parser in NetNewsWire 2.0b10 is a complete re-write. It’s much improved. (The <a href="https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire2.0b10.php#atom">change notes page</a> goes into detail, listing tests it passes and so on.)</p>

<p>Aside from doing the things it’s supposed to do—decoding base64, handling namespaces, etc.—it adds a feature that I really like: it presents <i>alternate</i>, <i>via</i>, and <i>related</i> links.</p>

<p>In case you don’t know what I’m talking about, I’ll explain...</p>

<p>An Atom item may contain multiple links. In the past, NetNewsWire just ignored the extra links. Now it parses them and presents them below the description.</p>

<p>For instance, <a href="http://annevankesteren.nl/feeds/href">Anne van Kesteren’s feed</a> often includes <i>related</i> links and sometimes includes <i>via</i> links. Those links are displayed immediately below the description, as in the below screen shot:</p>

<p><img src="/images/viaRelatedLinks.png" height="230" width="361" alt="Screen shot showing related and via links" /></p>

<p>This is a pretty cool feature of Atom, that you have a specified way of adding these links.</p>
