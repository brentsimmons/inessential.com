Atom titles are oddly difficult — so I have a question. I think I know the answer, but I’m not sure it’s correct, so I’d appreciate some help.</p>

<p>Consider the following title element (which is a simplified example from an actual feed):</p>

<p><code>&lt;title&gt;&amp;lt;foo&amp;gt;&lt;/title&gt;</code></p>

<p>The way I read the <a href="http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/atom-format-spec.php#rfc.section.3.1">spec</a>, this is equivalent to:</p>

<p><code>&lt;title mode="xml" type="text/plain"&gt;&amp;lt;foo&amp;gt;&lt;/title&gt;</code></p>

<p>This means that:</p>

<p>1. The value is inline XML.</p>

<p>2. The value should be displayed as plain text.</p>

<p>This means — I think — that the <code>&amp;lt;</code> and <code>&amp;gt;</code> should never get translated to <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>In other words, a client must display it as <code>&amp;lt;foo&amp;gt;</code> and <i>not</i> as <code>&lt;foo&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Correct?</p>

<p>I think — though I could be wrong — that in order for the client to display <code>&lt;foo&gt;</code>, the title element would have had to look like this:</p>

<p><code>&lt;title&gt;&lt;foo&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</code></p>

<p>Yes? No?
