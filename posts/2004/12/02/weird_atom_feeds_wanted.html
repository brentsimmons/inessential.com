I’ve been rewriting the Atom parser in NetNewsWire 2.0 — and I just got it to pass the <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2004/06/02/Aggregator-i18n-tests">internationalization tests</a> Sam Ruby posted earlier this year.</p>

<p>The screen shot looks funny, but it’s actually an indication that the tests passed.</p>

<p>I’m looking for more tests — and, especially, for weird Atom feeds. By “weird” I don’t mean bad or invalid, I mean out-of-the-ordinary. For instance, I haven’t found any feeds yet that use base64 encoding, and I want to test that I have base64 decoding working now. So, if you know of any weird feeds, please send me email or post a comment.</p>

<p>(I love my new Atom parser, by the way. Sometimes you write code that is surprisingly geometric and elegant and you can just plain see how right it is. And other times you don’t. It’s like the difference between the Parthenon and the nests birds make. Both are beautiful in their way — but, when it comes to software, you want the Parthenon instead of a semi-chaotic accretion of small sticks.)
