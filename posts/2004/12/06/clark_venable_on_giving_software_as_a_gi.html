Clark Venable: <a href="http://www.romanvenable.net/908">I Wish There Were An Easier Way To Give Software</a>: “What I’m envisioning is a service, by Kagi for example (as they’re the ones that seem to accept payment for most such software), that will print the name of the software, its web site, and the registration code on a gift card that can then be tucked in a holiday card and given as a gift or stocking stuffer, or even mailed as an e-gift (like an iCard).”
