Now that 1.0 is out, what’s next for <a href="http://ranchero.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>?</p>

<p>Below are some—but not nearly all—of the things planned for the future.
</p>
<h4>Fixing that time bug!</h4>
<p>
The most commonly reported bug is actually a WordPress bug, unfortunately. In some configurations, the time on the server for a post sent from MarsEdit is incorrect: it doesn’t take into account the time zone difference properly.</p>

<p>My hope is that this will be fixed in WordPress 1.3.</p>

<p>(By the way—there are many MarsEdit users who love WordPress. My point isn’t to knock it: WordPress is quite cool.)
</p>
<h4>Blogger and titles</h4>
<p>
MarsEdit doesn’t yet support titles for Blogger.</p>

<p>It will—but it requires implementing the Atom weblog editing API first. This is MarsEdit’s top priority.
</p>
<h4>WYSIWYG editing</h4>
<p>
Dave Hyatt has said publicly that WebCore will support <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2004_07.html#005905">HTML editing</a>. We plan to use it to add WYSIWYG editing to MarsEdit.</p>

<p>It will be a choice, of course—those of you who prefer plain text won’t have to use the WYSIWYG editing feature.
</p>
<h4>More image features</h4>
<p>
People ask for thumbnails, drag-and-drop, resizing, iPhoto integration, etc. etc. All excellent ideas.</p>

<p>Though MarsEdit’s main point is to be a literate weblog editor—an editor for people who love writing—images are very important.
</p>
<h4>Uploading enclosures</h4>
<p>
I’m not even sure yet if it’s technically possible, given the current weblog editing APIs—but folks want to upload files that get added as RSS enclosures (aka podcasts).
</p>
<h4>Cocoal.icio.us support</h4>
<p>
Should MarsEdit include <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> features, or should it work with <a href="http://www.scifihifi.com/cocoalicious/">Cocoal.icio.us</a>?</p>

<p>On one hand, you have people who say, “I want each app to do one thing and do it well.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, you have people who say, “I want an app that puts it all together, the whole package.”</p>

<p>Is del.icio.us support part of that “one thing” that weblog editors should do? Is it a necessary part of “the whole package?”</p>

<p>I don’t know!</p>

<p>But, when in doubt, if there’s another app to work with, why not support that other app instead of redoing the work? After all, MarsEdit already works with a variety of newsreaders, browsers, and text editors—why not work with Cocoal.icio.us too.</p>

<p>An opposite case could be made, surely, and it wouldn’t be wrong—but my personal preference is to work with other apps as much as possible.
</p>
<h4>More...</h4>
<p>The above list is not comprehensive—there’s plenty more. MarsEdit is just getting started.</p>

<p>But the above covers the most common bugs and feature requests we’ve been hearing.
