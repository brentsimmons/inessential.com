Over the last few days I’ve been getting into using <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/3/9/16838/14935">screen</a>. To over-simplify, the idea is sort of like tabbed browsing for the command line (except that you don’t actually see the tabs).</p>

<p>It has a long man page and lots of options, but mostly I’ve just got the hang of ctrl-a c (for new command-line “tab”) and ctrl-a n (for switching between the various “tabs”).</p>

<p>I put “tab” in quotes because it’s not really tabs, but it’s enough like tabs so that it’s an easy way to describe it.</p>

<p>If you find yourself opening lots of Terminal windows, then it’s worth looking at screen.</p>

<p>Another option is <a href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/">iTerm</a>, which is an actual tabbed terminal app for OS X. (My only wish for iTerm is tabs that are more like the tabs in Safari or <a href="http://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> or <a href="http://www.cocoatech.com/pf.php">PathFinder</a>, rather than just what appears to be a standard NSTabView. In other words, the tabs could take up less screen real estate.)
