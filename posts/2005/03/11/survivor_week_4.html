I’ve become a big fan of Jeff Harrell’s Survivor commentary. Here’s the latest: <a href="http://www.shapeofdays.com/2005/03/oh_give_me_a_ho.html">Oh, give me a home: Survivor Week 4</a>: “We don’t get to see all of what Ian chooses, but we do get to see two of the items: a rip saw and a pickaxe. These will come in handy for killing and dismembering his teammates...”
