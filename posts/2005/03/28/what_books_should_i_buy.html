For my birthday I got some money to buy some books. (When I’m not programming, I’m reading.)</p>

<p>I have a pretty good idea of what books I want to buy, but I’m always looking for cool books I don’t know about.</p>

<p>My interests are literary fiction, science fiction, spy/thriller novels, history, science, languages, art, and animals. (And other things too, but those are the main ones.)</p>

<p>Are there any books you’ve read lately that you just plain love, that you’d recommend to me?
