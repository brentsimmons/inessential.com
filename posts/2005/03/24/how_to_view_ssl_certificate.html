If you’re at a secure site in Safari, how do you view information about the certificate?</p>

<p>In Firefox it’s easy—just click on the lock icon. But I can’t figure out how to do it in Safari (or IE either).</p>

<p>I found that Keychain Access stores certificates, but I was hoping there was an easier way to do this from the browser, or even from the command line. (Google doesn’t turn up anything for me, so it may be just that it’s not do-able, but I figured I’d ask anyway.)
