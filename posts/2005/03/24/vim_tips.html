Bram Moolenaar: <a href="http://www.moolenaar.net/habits.html">Seven habits of effective text editing</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s my deal: I get frustrated with Xcode rather often. (Xcode is wonderful except for the things that bug me.) So I was inspired by Mark Dalrymple’s post on using <a href="http://borkware.com/rants/emacs-dev/">Emacs for Cocoa development</a> to consider a command-line alternative.</p>

<p>I’ve been using Emacs and Vim both, trying to find out which I prefer. You know what? It’s a tough call. I actually don’t have a position in this particular holy war.</p>

<p>On the one hand, Emacs really is all it’s cracked up to be—that is, it’s practically an entire operating system on its own. Vim suits my philosophy and aesthetics better.</p>

<p>Except that Vim’s being modal continues to freak me out. It’s as if my brain refuses to deal with this, and I keep typing commands when I want to type text. Then I curse and wonder what the hell just happened to my document.</p>

<p>Which is better for C and Objective-C editing? The idea is to run Xcode only when I absolutely need to.</p>

<p>On the other hand, maybe I can use BBEdit instead. For all that I’ve used BBEdit over the years, I’ve never used it for C/Objective-C programming. (I use it for plain text, HTML, PHP, to-do lists, etc.)</p>

<p>I’ll have to investigate.
