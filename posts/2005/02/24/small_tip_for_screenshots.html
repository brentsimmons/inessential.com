Here’s a small tip (which most of you already know, I’m sure)...</p>

<p>When you go to post a screenshot of an application, and you don’t want your desktop background in the screenshot—when you want a white background, that is—just create an empty folder in the Finder, make the folder really big, then bring the app to the front so that the background is the white of that empty folder.
