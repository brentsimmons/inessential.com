<p>NetNewsWire Lite 2.0b22 has been posted to the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php">NetNewsWire Betas</a> page.</p>

<p>We hadnâ€™t done a beta of the Lite version since 2.0b6â€”which meant, among other things, that Lite users didnâ€™t have the user interface changes that were in recent betas of the full version.</p>

<p>The idea was in part to make the interface more attractive, give it a more modern lookâ€”but the main reasons have to do with usability.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://rentzsch.com/macosx/pushingTheEdge">Pushing the Edge</a>, Jonathan â€œWolfâ€ Rentzsch wrote: â€œThe controls have been pushed to the absolute bottom. The lists abut the left and right sides of the window. Not a pixel of margin. The new UI looks simpler but actually does more.â€</p>

<p>Just for jazz, here a couple more screen shots: one with the <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw2/nnwlite2.0b22notoolbar.png">toolbar hidden</a> and one using the <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw2/nnwlite2.0b22graphite.png">Graphite appearance</a>.</p>

<p>This release of NetNewsWire Lite gets some other new features too, such as per-feed refresh settings, datelines, and subscriptions sorting. See the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/lite2.0b22.php">change notes</a> for more details.
