I admit—I’m hooked on the new <a href="http://www.battlestargalactica.com/newbat.htm">Battlestar Galactica</a>.</p>

<p>I’ll also admit that I’m old enough to have watched the original series.</p>

<p>I used to like to draw pictures of the Vipers in battle. (I was a kid, okay?) Now when I watch the show I keep <i>feeling</i> like I want to draw pictures of the Vipers in battle. I would be kidding, except I’m not.
