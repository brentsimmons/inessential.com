A cool thing at isbn.nu—RSS search feeds for books. Any search result that lists books can be subscribed to.</p>

<p>Say you’re interested in cats, and you want an RSS search feed about cats. Here’s what to do:</p>

<p>1. Go to <a href="http://isbn.nu/">isbn.nu</a>.</p>

<p>2. Type <i>cats</i> in the search field and click the Search button.</p>

<p>3. Use the URL that appears in your browser as the subscription URL. Your aggregator should do auto-discovery to find the feed.</p>

<p>(For instance, if you’re using NetNewsWire, you can drag the favicon into the Subscriptions list. Or use the Services menu. Or just copy-and-paste.)</p>

<p>4. Now you’ll have a feed with a title like “Title word matches for cats.” You should probably set the refresh interval to something like 24 hours, since the results aren’t updated so frequently (and you probably don’t need to know about cat books on an hourly basis, do you?)</p>

<p>The results in the feed are the most recent books, with a maximum of 25 items.</p>

<p>Pretty cool, I think.
