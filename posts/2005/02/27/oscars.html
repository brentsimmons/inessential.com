<p>The thing is, I love movies, it’s just that the nominated movies are usually movies that I don’t want to see.</p>

<p>But anyway, it doesn’t matter—the real fun of the Oscars is talking about the <a href="http://www.eonline.com/Features/Awards/Oscars2002/RedCarpetPics/index13.html">funny clothes</a> people wear.
