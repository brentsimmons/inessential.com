Sometimes I feel like I must be ten years old... I was staring at this code and wondering why things weren’t working:</p>

<p><code>for (i = 0; i++; i &lt; [_tabItems count])</code></p>

<p>Nuts! (Obviously, I figured it out. And felt dumb, so I immediately had to post about it. Note that I could use NSEnumerator instead, which would have saved this particular headache, but I tend to prefer the old-fashioned for loop since it tells me at-a-glance what’s going on. Except this time I messed it up.)
