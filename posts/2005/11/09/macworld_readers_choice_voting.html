Please <a href="http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/editors/2005/11/eddyvoting/index.php?lsrc=editorsblog">vote</a> in the Macworld readers’ choice awards!</p>

<p>NetNewsWire was nominated along with some other really fantastically cool apps: Transmit, Comic Life, Audio Hijack Pro, and more. Obviously, I’d be glad if you vote for NetNewsWire, but it’s more important that you just go vote.
