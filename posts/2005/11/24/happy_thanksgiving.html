Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

<p>When I think about it—which is more often than you think—I’m surprised to find that I can create things that other people like. It’s what I wanted out of life as far back as I can remember. And so I am profoundly thankful to everybody who uses and likes software I’ve worked on. Thank you!</p>

<p>(I wouldn’t be surprised if lots of other developers have the same thanks to give. We all want great users, and if we’re fortunate enough to have them, well, we owe the universe a beer. And more software.)
