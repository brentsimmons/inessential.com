<a href="http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2005/10/31.html#1356">Gus Mueller</a>: “So here&#039;s an idea that I’d like to see... a way to publish realtime information (server issues, alarms, *bing* another copy of VoodooPad sold, whatever) to NetNewsWire, and not have to wait till the top of the hour to find out about it. Sort of like Growl, but in a list.”</p>

<p><i>Update 10:25 a.m.</i>: to be clear, no changes in NetNewsWire are needed. Gus is talking about building on features that already exist in NetNewsWire (scriptability and script feeds) and technology such as SQLite.
