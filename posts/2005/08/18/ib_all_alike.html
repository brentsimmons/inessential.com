Since tomorrow is Friday it’s report-a-bug-to-Apple day. I figured I’d run my bug by y’all in case it turns out to be not a bug. (Like <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=3153">last week</a>! Though, arguably, it’s still a bug.)</p>

<p>Here’s the bug: Interface Builder often doesn’t display enough of an item’s name to be useful. You get things like the following:</p>

<p><img src="http://inessential.com/images/ibAllAlike.png" width="578" height="155" alt="Many items all alike in Interface Builder" /></p>

<p>It wouldn’t be so bad if you could at least hold your mouse over an item and get its name, as in the Dock. But you can’t—you have to actually select an item and look at the Info window to find out what it is.</p>

<p>(For programmers, time is <i>the</i> precious commodity. A frictionless workflow is essential. Any little thing like this that slows you down is a candidate for streamlining.)
