DrunkenBatman reports on the <a href="http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000635.html">Safari Image of Doom</a> for Report-an-Apple-Bug Friday. I haven’t reported my bug for the day yet, since I haven’t picked one yet.</p>

<p>Part of me wants to report as a bug that thing you see in Safari RSS and in Spotlight, where you have the scrollbar to the right of a non-scrolling area. I think it’s worth trying to nip this in the bud before you start seeing it everywhere, in more Apple apps and in apps from independent developers.</p>

<p>But I’ll probably report some other bug.</p>

<p>Speaking of Spotlight, Rory Prior did a mock-up of a <a href="http://www.thinkmac.co.uk/blog/2005/08/spotlight-revisited-making-it-better.html">proposed revised UI for Spotlight</a> that I quite like—it solves a bunch of problems in the current Spotlight UI.</p>
