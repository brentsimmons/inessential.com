For Report-an-Apple-Bug Friday I reported #4234503: “Round Textured Button highlights in gray when it should highlight in blue.”</p>

<p>The gist of it is this: in Tiger there’s a new button type that matches the toolbar buttons in Safari, System Preferences, Dictionary, and other apps, but the button can’t be used as-is because when you press it, it highlights gray instead of blue.</p>

<p>(Yes, I wrote about this <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=3102">before</a>.)</p>

<p>So... did you report a bug to Apple today? Let’s have bug ids!
