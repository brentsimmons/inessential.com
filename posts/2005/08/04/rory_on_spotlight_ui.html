<a href="http://www.thinkmac.co.uk/blog/2005/08/bad-ui-in-os-x-spotlight.html">Rory Prior</a> takes a look at Spotlight’s user interface: “First of all it looks like a shining beacon of unified goodness. It could have been a brushed metal monstrosity, but someone put their foot down and said no. My thanks to that person.”
