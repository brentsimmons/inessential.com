Michael McCracken: <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/blog/blosxom.pl/computers/mac/OpenAppleQ.html">The Open Apple Question</a>: “OS X has been pretty successful building on open source lower-level software, like the darwin layer, gcc, and all the open source networking software. More recently, WebKit is open-source, and bugs are being fixed by people without apple.com in their email.”
