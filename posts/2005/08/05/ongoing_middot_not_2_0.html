Tim Bray: <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/08/04/Web-2.0">Not 2.0</a>: “I just wanted to say how much I’ve come to dislike this ‘Web 2.0’ faux-meme. It’s not only vacuous marketing hype, it can’t possibly be right.”</p>

<p>I agree that 2.0 doesn’t quite seem correct. If I had to give the Web a version number, I’d call it Web 0.2. We’re still in <i>very</i> early days.
