So here’s my question: if Google replaces Windows with their web-based operating system, on what operating system will it run?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0000014/2005/08/24.html">answer</a> is, well, Windows.</p>

<p>A computer needs graphics routines, networking, a window manager, UI toolkit, XML parser, HTML display, etc.—even Google’s desktop apps need these things. Web browsers certainly needs these things.</p>

<p>But “these things” are provided by Windows. (And Mac OS X, Linux, <a href="http://www.yellowtab.com/">ZETA</a>, etc.)</p>

<p>Dammit, Jim, I’m a developer, not an analyst. What is it that I don’t understand?
