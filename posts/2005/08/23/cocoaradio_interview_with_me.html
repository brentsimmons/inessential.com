There’s a <a href="http://www.cocoaradio.com/2005/08/cocoaradio_inte.html">CocoaRadio interview</a> with me.</p>

<p>I can’t listen to it—it’s that whole your-voice-on-tape-thing—so I don’t know if I come across weird or not. (Oh, probably.)</p>

<p>But it was fun to do, and I recommend it. In other words—if you get email from Blake, say yes, you’ll do it.
