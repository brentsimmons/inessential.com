<a href="http://www.gigliwood.com/weblog/MacOSX/Report-an-Apple-Bug.html">Dan Wood</a>: “I’m going to try to start a new regular feature for most Fridays... My idea is Report-an-Apple-Bug Friday, in which I point out an annoying Apple ‘bug’ and encourage all of my readers (Yes, you!) to report that bug (or some other bug you are inspired by) to Apple.”</p>

<p>I think this is a good idea—I myself get lazy about reporting bugs to Apple, so why not have a day for it?</p>

<p>I reported #4214767. The bug, which appears to be new in Tiger, is that when you drag a file or folder to a CD, it creates an alias rather than a copy.</p>

<p>(The work-around—holding down the option key—is easy, yes, but that doesn’t mean the bug shouldn’t be fixed.)
