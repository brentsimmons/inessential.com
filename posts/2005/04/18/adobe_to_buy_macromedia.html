So <a href="http://www.macworld.com/news/2005/04/18/adobe/index.php">Adobe is going to buy Macromedia</a>.</p>

<p>My first thought was, “Oh no, there goes competition in the graphics space.” But maybe that’s not true? Or, if true, maybe it doesn’t matter?</p>

<p>What do <i>you</i> think? I’m very curious.
