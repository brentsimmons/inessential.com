We didn’t get permission in time for this latest NetNewsWire beta to include <a href="http://www.bartelme.at/showroom_detail.asp?detail=45">Bartelme Design’s style sheets</a>. (My fault! I should have emailed sooner than Saturday.)</p>

<p>But we did get permission, so the next beta will include BD Aqua Floating and BD Graphit Floating. You don’t have to wait, of course, you can go download and install them yourself.</p>

<p>(To install a style, just double-click on the *.nnwstyle file.)
