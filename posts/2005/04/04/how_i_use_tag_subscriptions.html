I subscribe to a few tag subscriptions aside from pictures of cats from Flickr.</p>

<p><i>osxcli</i> at del.icio.us is one of my favorites. Lots of good stuff for <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/calling_all_ter.html">Terminal nerds</a> and would-bes.</p>

<p>I also subscribe to cocoa, sqlite, and of course tags for our own software.</p>

<p>They all go into a group named Tags. Since these feeds are not really breaking-news feeds, I set a custom refresh interval of nine hours, and I set them to get skipped during a manual refresh. This is important, by the way—it’s nicer to the folks behind these services if you refresh only as much as really makes sense.</p>

<p>(I chose nine hours instead of eight so that I would be surprised. I like it when some things <i>don’t</i> happen at the same time every day.)
