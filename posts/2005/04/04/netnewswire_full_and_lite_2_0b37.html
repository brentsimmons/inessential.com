<p>NetNewsWire (full and Lite) 2.0b37 has been posted to the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php">NetNewsWire betas</a> page.</p>

<p>(Side note: woo-hoo!)</p>

<p>New features include tag subscriptions, syncing, feed detection for the browser, per-feed podcast settings, and more. Bugs were fixed, performance was boosted. See the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire2.0b37.php">change notes</a> for all the details.</p>

<p>One of the new features has quickly become one of my favorite features: tag subscriptions. They’re kind of like search engine subscriptions, but instead of subscribing to a search you subscribe to a tag at Del.icio.us, Flickr, or Technorati.</p>

<p>For instance, I like cat pictures (to <i>not</i> like cat pictures would be to not like the web), so I created a tag subscription for the tag <i>cats</i> using Flickr. (Choose File > New Special Subscription > Tag to create a tag subscription.)</p>

<p>We’ve been calling this beta the “almost-there” beta. Here’s what remains to do before shipping 2.0:</p>

<p>1. Fix some more bugs.<br />
2. Add a bit more polish.<br />
3. Review and edit the Help book.</p>

<p>As always, your feedback and bug reports are very helpful.
