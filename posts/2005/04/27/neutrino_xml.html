<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/fraserspeirs/868220.html">Fraser Speirs</a>: “A Neutrino feed is a collection of pointers to other syndication feeds—say, a blog, Flickr and Del.icio.us—all of which belong to one individual. It’s essentially indirection for feeds—point someone at your Neutrino feed and they can then discover your blog feed, your Flickr feed, your Del.icio.us feed, and anything else you care to include which you publish and can be syndicated.”</p>

<p>Before anyone asks if we plan to support this in NetNewsWire: the answer is yes, we do. It’s too late to make it into 2.0, but we plan to add support in a post-2.0 release.
