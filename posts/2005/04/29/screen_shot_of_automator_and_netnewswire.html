Automator and NetNewsWire screen shot:</p>

<p>The workflow shown in this screen shot may not be one you’d ever use—but, actually, come to think of it, I can imagine cases where you might.</p>

<p>It first gets the current URL from NetNewsWire—from the current headline or current web page. Then it asks Safari to get all the link URLs from that page. Then it asks NetNewsWire to subscribe to all those links.</p>

<p>It could be handy when you have a page with a ton of feeds on it and you want to subscribe to all of them.</p>

<p>The point, at least for now, is, “Hey, this stuff works.” And Automator is oddly addictive—I enjoy clicking the Run button and watching it do its thing.
