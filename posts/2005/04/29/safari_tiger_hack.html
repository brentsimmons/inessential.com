If you use Interface Builder to turn Safari’s browser from metal to regular, then have it use the unified title/toolbar look, it’s kind of cool. (At least, I like it. Not sure how well it wears yet, though.)</p>

<p>(Always take care and make backups when editing with Interface Builder, of course.)</p>

<p>One thing I’ve noticed about Safari is that it has a customizable toolbar now. Yes!</p>

<p>But, on the downside, I can’t figure out how to get rid of the search field. (I always use Huevos instead, and I like having the extra space for the URL.) Does anyone know how to remove it?</p>

<p>Safari’s toolbar isn’t quite a conventional Cocoa toolbar. No chiclet in the upper-right of the window and no options for showing icon & text or icon only.</p>

<p>Still, though, I’m quite pleased, since it always kind of bugged me how you had to customize the address bar via menu commands. This is <i>much</i> better.
