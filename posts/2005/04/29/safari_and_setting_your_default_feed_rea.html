My favorite feature of Safari is—of course—that you can set your default aggregator.</p>

<p>So any time you see the blue RSS button in Safari, just click to subscribe in your default RSS reader instead.</p>

<p>It goes beyond just clicking on the RSS button, though. With every feed I’ve tested, just clicking on the link in the web page sends the URL to NetNewsWire. (It doesn’t have to be a ‘feed’ URL: Safari figures out that it’s a feed and does the right thing.)</p>

<p>It’s the one-click-subscribing we’ve wanted for so long but didn’t have until now. This is a <i>big</i> step forward. I couldn’t be more pleased.
