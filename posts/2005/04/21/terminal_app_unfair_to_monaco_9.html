Whenever I use BBEdit’s shell worksheet, I’m reminded how much it bugs me that Terminal doesn’t render Monaco 9 very well.</p>

<p>In the screen shot, Terminal is in front and BBEdit behind. Note the “to” in “total” and the “dr” in “drwx.” The rendering in Terminal is distracting.</p>

<p>(I’ve been using Monaco 9 for text editing, programming, etc. for at least 10 years, and I’m not going to switch now.)</p>

<p>Here’s what I want—and what I would pay for—in a Terminal app.</p>

<p>1. Good rendering of Monaco 9! (As in the BBEdit shell worksheet.)</p>

<p>2. Tabs. (Using space-saving widgets more like browser tabs, as in Transmit or Interarchy, or a drawer a la BBEdit or OmniWeb.)</p>

<p>3. Performance at least equal to Apple’s Terminal app. (Better is nice but not required.)</p>

<p>Sometimes I wish BBEdit had a terminal, not just shell worksheets. But that’s probably not appropriate for a text editor. (I could mention Emacs right here, but the thing about Emacs is that it can be used to prove both sides of the argument.)</p>

<p>(From time to time I’ve considered writing a Terminal app myself. But it would be one of those things where you get endless streams of requests like “I need the meta key to frobble the jim-nose when smatterizing the sleepnorp. On Tuesdays.”)</p>

<p>A really good terminal app would be wonderful for people who, for whatever reasons, spend a certain amount of their time every day in that world.
