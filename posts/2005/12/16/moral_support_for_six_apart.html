I read on Niall Kennedy’s weblog about a TypePad <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/12/typepad_outage.html">outage</a>—and I just wanted to send the Six Apart folks a bit of moral support at a time when they might be able to use it.</p>

<p>You may not know that before I did NetNewsWire and MarsEdit I worked at UserLand Software where I helped write weblog systems. Much of my work was on Manila—not just writing code but helping keep the servers up-and-running.</p>

<p>There were lots of 4 a.m. nights for me. Lots. Not a few. Lots. We were hosting many thousands of free sites, and we were developing the software and learning how to make it scale as we were doing the hosting.</p>

<p>And we learned a lot and the software improved steadily.</p>

<p>However, after a while I personally couldn’t do it anymore, and I switched to writing desktop apps, vowing never to write weblog systems—or, really, <i>host</i> weblog systems—ever again.</p>

<p>It’s not just hard work, it can be tough on the psyche too—you’re talking about <i>weblogs</i>, which people feel are an extension of themselves. It’s not some boring abstract thing, not at all, it’s about people’s passions. Their lives, really.</p>

<p>It’s a high calling, and I had to stop after a couple years—but I applaud Six Apart and other folks who are willing to do this. So, when things go wrong—as they will—I think they deserve our thanks and support.
