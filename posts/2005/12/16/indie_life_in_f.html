<a href="http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2005/12/16.html#1391">Gus Mueller</a>: “Gus starts a track he had prepared for this very moment and moves to his (music) keyboard to begin playing in the key of F.”</p>

<p>I identify with every part of this story—except the key of F part. F! No way! For me it’s E. Sometimes A or D. G in a rare blue moon. But F? Why oh why? The humanity!
