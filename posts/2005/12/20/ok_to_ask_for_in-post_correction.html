It <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3236">seems that people agree</a> that weblogs should correct errors of fact in posts rather than just assume people will read comments.</p>

<p>So, next question: if you notice a factual error in someoneâ€™s post, should you point it out if it seems important to you? How far can you go in insisting on a correction? Do the answers to the previous questions change if the error is related to you or your work somehow?
