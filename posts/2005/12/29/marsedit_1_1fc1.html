<p>This release includes an updated Help Book, more graceful preview window updating, and a bunch of bug fixes. (The full scoop is on the beta page.)</p>

<p>In case you’re wondering: Gus is doing a fantastic job—not just doing the coding but also running the beta program. Very cool. (If you haven’t yet read his 
<a href="http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2005/12/25.html">How to become an independent programmer in just 1068 days</a>, you should. It’s good.)
