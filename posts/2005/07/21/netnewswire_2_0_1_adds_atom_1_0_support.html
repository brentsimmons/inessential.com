<p>We released full and Lite versions of <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire 2.0.1</a> today.</p>

<p>The main point of this release is to support Atom 1.0 feeds—but it also fixes a couple crashing bugs and updates the Sites Drawer. See the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire201.php">change notes</a> for more info.</p>

<p>Aside from writing code to support Atom 1.0 feeds, we also made a tough decision about support for Jaguar (OS X 10.2.8): the NetNewsWire 2.0.x series will be the last to support Jaguar. (This release may or may not be the last of this series.)</p>

<p>To be clear: NetNewsWire 2.0.1—this release—supports Jaguar. But NetNewsWire 2.1 and greater won’t.</p>

<p>(We’re already working on NetNewsWire 2.1—on an Intel Mac, even.)</p>

<p>Even though the rule of thumb—“support the current OS minus one”—supports our decision, it was still tough, since there are of course people still running Jaguar.</p>

<p>And we have, well, a sentimental attachment to Jaguar. It was a <i>great</i> release, the first release of OS X that really rocked.</p>
