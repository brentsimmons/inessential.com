<a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2005/07/01#1338">Ted Leung explains</a> that he doesn’t use the iTunes podcasting support, or the podcasting support built in to NetNewsWire—instead he uses a modified version of Clint Ecker’s <a href="http://phaedo.cx/archives/2004/11/29/podderpy-version-033/">Podder.py</a> script as a script subscription in NetNewsWire.</p>

<p>This way he can organize his podcasts by duration. Ted writes:<blockquote>My modified version of podder looks at the duration of the podcast, and puts all podcasts shorter than a 35 minute ferry ride into Podcast-short. This makes it easy for me to optimize my Podcast listening by location.</blockquote></p>

<p>I love hearing stuff like this. Adding scripting to an app is a little work, but it pays off hugely when people can do their own custom workflows.
