Tim Bray on <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/07/14/Atom-1.0">Atom 1.0</a>: “It’s cooked and ready to serve.”</p>

<p>That’s good news. Naturally, the next release of NetNewsWire will include Atom 1.0 support.</p>

<p>A quick look at the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-atompub-format-10.txt">current draft</a> tells me there haven’t been any major upheavals since 0.3—it looks similar, and the changes I noticed are quite welcome. (The Atom Text Construct is simpler, I’m pleased to see.)</p>

<p>An Atom 1.0 feed would work reasonably well in the current version of NetNewsWire—except that the namespace URL has changed from http://purl.org/atom/ns# to http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom, which prevents it from working at all. (This isn’t a complaint, by the way—it’s correct that the namespace URL changed.)</p>

<p>If I have more to say about Atom, any gotchas or interesting observations, I will. But, most likely, it’s a straightforward matter of writing some code and doing a bunch of testing.</p>

<p>We will continue to support Atom 0.3 feeds for the foreseeable future. (Just as we continue to support RSS 0.9x feeds.)
