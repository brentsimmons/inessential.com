I’m curious—which Apple apps do you use the most? I mean, outside the operating system itself.</p>

<p>As a developer, my personal list is rather boring: Xcode, followed by Terminal. (I use Camino as a browser and Mailsmith for email, or else Safari and Mail would be way up there for me.)</p>

<p>(I wish I could say GarageBand was high on my list, but I need to carve out some time for it.)
