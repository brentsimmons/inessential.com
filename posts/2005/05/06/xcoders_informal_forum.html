On May 12 I’ll be at the next <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xcoder/">Seattle Xcoders group</a> meeting, answering questions about running an independent Mac software business. It’s an informal forum, just questions and talk. (Click the link above for details on what the Xcoders group is and where it’ll be.)</p>

<p>See you there, I hope!
