With the release of NetNewsWire 2.0 finished I can finally upgrade to Tiger. I’ve been running it on a test machine, but haven’t yet upgraded my development and day-to-day machines.</p>

<p>If you’re not a developer, you may not realize that upgrading to a new version of OS X also means upgrading the development tools—which can have unexpected side effects. It’s not something you do during the final phase of shipping software, which is why I had to put it off until now.</p>

<p>So today is the day to get Tiger running on my development machine. Depending on how things go I’ll be able to get all my projects building and running fine. (I did some practice builds on my test machine, and all was well.)</p>

<p>After getting Tiger installed, my next step is to move from cvs to Subversion. I’ve been looking forward to it for <i>months</i>.</p>

<p>I’m taking an infrastructure break, in other words. For me it’s fun.
