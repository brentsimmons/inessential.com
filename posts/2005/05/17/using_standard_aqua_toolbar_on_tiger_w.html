We’ve had lots of people tell us that they really like how NetNewsWire uses the unified title/toolbar look on Tiger. And we’ve heard from two people who prefer the traditional Aqua horizontal stripes.</p>

<p>Things like this are very much a matter of personal taste, of course.</p>

<p>At any rate, anticipating that there would be a few people who prefer the traditional look, we added a hidden pref that tells NetNewsWire to use the traditional toolbar look.</p>

<p>Here’s what to do:</p>

<p>1. Quit NetNewsWire.</p>

<p>2. In Terminal, copy-and-paste the following then hit return:</p>

<p><pre>defaults write com.ranchero.NetNewsWire traditionalAquaToolbar YES</pre></p>

<p>3. Launch NetNewsWire—it will use the horizontal-stripes toolbar look.</p>

<p>If you want to go back to unified title/toolbar, repeat the above but with NO instead of YES.
