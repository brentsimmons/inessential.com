Other developers write about walking the user interface line—trying to be consistent but also having to create custom widgets to stay modern.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.advenio.com/weblogs/2005/05/on-software-design-new-inconsistencies.html">Michael Dupuis</a>: “Sure there are ‘lesser’ elements available to us as developers, but they often don’t have the ‘bling’ that users come to expect.”</p>

<p><a href="http://weblog.karelia.com/MacOSX/Go,_Brent,_Go!.html">Dan Wood</a>: “We have to walk the line in our user interface decisions all the time, trying to make an application look consistent with the Mac interface, and also ‘modern.’”
