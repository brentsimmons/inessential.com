You might wonder why I’ve been writing all this about watching trends in OS X user interface design.</p>

<p>The main point is <i>not</i> to ding Apple for UI inconsistencies. The point is that it’s absurd for developers to have to spend so much time watching trends in OS X user interface design.</p>

<p>I <i>want</i> Apple to innovate, to try things, to make things cool—and I want them to continue as the leaders in usability, which I still think is <i>the</i> big draw of Macs. It may be a tight-rope act, but Apple has been doing this particular high-wire dance for decades now.</p>

<p>At the same time—<i>at the same time</i>, please sing some arias—I know I’m asking alot—I’d like to see some leadership beyond just sometimes-contradictory examples.
