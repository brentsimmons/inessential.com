Before OS X, the common shape for Mac buttons was rounded rectangles.</p>

<h4>The new thing</h4>
<p>
Then, in early versions of OS X, the new thing for buttons was the capsule shape—as you still see in dialog and sheets, for instance.</p>

Then, with the iApps and Safari, the <i>new</i> new thing was rounded rectangles.</p>

<p>But—think about it—aren’t you getting just a little bit tired of the rounded rectangles?

<h4>The new new new thing</h4>

Though Tiger has lots of rounded rectangles, it appears to me that the <i>new</i> new new thing is the capsule shape. There are differences, of course:</p>

<p>1. They tend to be flatter—they aren’t as 3-D as OK and Cancel buttons, for instance.</p>

<p>2. They use either a single gradient—or they use that two-gradient glass look (that you see in many other places and is itself a trend worthy of note).</p>

<p>(You <i>do</i> still see plenty of rounded rectangles, especially for objects that aren’t exactly buttons—the line of Dashboard widgets at the bottom of the screen, for instance. A capsule shape doesn’t work that well when the rectangle is a square.)</p>

<p>What is most interesting to me about the current capsule buttons is that we have competing visions: single gradient vs. glass look. Note for instance these two Save buttons, one from the Finder and one from Mail. The Finder button uses a gradient, while the Mail button uses the glass look (which it also uses in its toolbar buttons).</p>

<p>(It’s as if hemlines have shortened a bit this year—but both basic black <i>and</i> floral prints are in style.)</p>

<p>Also interesting is that the Finder is using the capsule shape with popup menus. I don’t recall ever having seen that before. I quite like it.</p>

<p>(We almost used this same widget in NetNewsWire, by the way: it would have been in the header cell above the subscriptions list; it would have allowed you to choose the sort order. We decided against it for reasons other than the appearance of the widget itself. [Our version was smaller than the widget shown above, to better fit that space.])
</p>
<h4>Prediction</h4>
<p>
Rounded rectangles will be back, probably some time next year. But there will be something different about them that I can’t predict. (Flatter? Less flat? Or...?)</p>

<p>But, right now, capsules are the thing.
