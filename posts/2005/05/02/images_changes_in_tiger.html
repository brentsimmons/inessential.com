Tiger has provoked some new reports regarding favicons in MarsEdit and NetNewsWire. In some cases, favicons that didn’t work now do work. In other cases, favicons that did work now do not work.</p>

<p>An example is Yahoo’s favicon. Try this in Panther and Tiger:</p>

<p><code>curl &#039;http://www.yahoo.com/favicon.ico&#039; > yahoo.ico<br />
open yahoo.ico</code></p>

<p>On my machines, Preview tries to open the file. On Panther it succeeds. On Tiger I get an error message saying that the file “may be corrupt or a file format that Preview doesn’t recognize.”</p>

<p>(I’ve just taken you the long way ’round. You could open Yahoo’s <a href="http://yahoo.com/">home page</a> in Safari and note that its favicon doesn’t appear in the address field on Tiger.)
