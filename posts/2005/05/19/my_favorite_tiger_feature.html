My favorite Tiger feature is that I can <i>turn off the caps lock key</i>. Yes!</p>

<p>I hit that key several times a day accidentally, and it just drives me nuts. I never actually use it for anything—it’s just an annoyance.</p>

<p>No longer!</p>

<p>In case you haven’t run across it, here’s how to turn it off.</p>

<p>1. Open System Preferences.</p>

<p>2. Click on Keyboard & Mouse.</p>

<p>3. At the bottom of the Keyboard tab is a “Modifier Keys...” button. Click it.</p>

<p>4. A sheet appears that lets you remap caps lock (and other keys). Choose “No Action” from the popup menu, then click OK.</p>

<p>It is a thing of beauty.
