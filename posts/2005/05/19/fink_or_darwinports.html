So, I’m curious, which do you prefer, <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink</a> or <a href="http://darwinports.org/">DarwinPorts</a>, and why?</p>

<p>I’ve just been doing the configure/make/make-install thing (as my people have done for centuries) but I’m thinking that a package management system might be a good idea.
