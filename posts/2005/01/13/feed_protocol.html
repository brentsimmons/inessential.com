In <a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2005/01/really_simple_s.html">Really Simple Subscription</a>, FeedDemon developer Nick Bradbury suggests using the <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/draft-obasanjo-feed-URI-scheme-02.html">feed: protocol</a> to make subscribing to RSS and Atom feeds easier.</p>

<p>I agree.</p>

<p>Nick also says that the solution is not perfect, and I agree with that too. But it does work and it has broad support in existing aggregators.</p>

<p>It’s just not used on the web that much yet. But, if it were used, we’d have really simple subscription today, since it’s already supported in so many aggregators.</p>

<p>(Someone will ask, “Why not use MIME types?” Answer: because aggregators need the URL of a feed, not the content, in order to subscribe.)</p>

<p>Sometimes I think the whole issue is just that we haven’t agreed on a graphic. Nick posted a “Feed” graphic on his post. Last year, <a href="http://www.bryanbell.com/">Bryan Bell</a> made a few: perhaps one of these would be good?</p>

<p><img src="http://ranchero.com/images/orangeFeed.gif" height="14" width="36" alt="Orange feed" /></p>

<p>I think that orange should not be used, to avoid confusion with the orange XML graphic.
