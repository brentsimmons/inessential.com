My thoughts about Macworld keynote stuff...</p>

<p>I’m at home working, not at the show, and I haven’t seen the keynote yet, just read the news. But I have a few thoughts so far:</p>

<p>1. The headless Mac is cool. Period. I want five. I won’t even turn them on, I just want them.</p>

<p>It’s crazy to me how Apple hardware can provoke such desire, but it does.</p>

<p>2. I don’t know if the iPod shuffle is cool. It’s not for me—but it doesn’t need me to buy one in order to sell a few million of them.</p>

<p>Which proves that not every Apple product provokes desire in the heart of every Mac geek. (By the way, I do have an iPod already, if that explains it.)</p>

<p>3. iWork is an odd duck.</p>

<p>I <i>so</i> wanted a great—or even good—word processor and spreadsheet to replace AppleWorks.</p>

<p>I don’t use Microsoft Office, and the open-source office products are, so far at least, still using non-native UI stuff. (They look and feel annoyingly weird. To me. But this will change. Eventually. I hope.)</p>

<p>Dori Smith says that <a href="http://www.backupbrain.com/2005_01_09_archive.html#a004357">Pages is not a word processor</a>, it’s entry-level page layout software. From what I’ve seen so far I agree. Think PageMaker, not Word.</p>

<p>So: no word processor, no spreadsheet.</p>

<p>But—you know what?—I bet somebody out there makes good word processors and spreadsheets for OS X. It’s just a matter of finding ones I like. (Any recommendations?)</p>

<p>4. Tiger, iLife, etc.—yes, all cool, I’m a happy Mac user.
