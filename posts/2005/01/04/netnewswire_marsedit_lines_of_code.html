A little while ago folks were posting the number of lines of code of their apps as generated by <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/">SLOCcount</a>. I’m just now getting around to it.</p>

<p>But first—here’s <a href="http://fraserspeirs.livejournal.com/798942.html">Fraser Speirs</a>, <a href="http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2004/12/8.html#1183">Gus Mueller</a>, and <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/blog/blosxom.pl/computers/mac/programming/SLOC.html">Michael McCracken</a>.</p>

<p>I can’t tell you NetNewsWire and MarsEdit stats separately, since both apps share a number of frameworks that we’ve written. Here’s the stats on both apps together, including the frameworks they share:</p>

<p>Total Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC)                = 86,433<br />
Development Effort Estimate, Person-Years (Person-Months) = 21.60 (259.25)<br />
Schedule Estimate, Years (Months)                         = 1.72 (20.66)<br />
Estimated Average Number of Developers (Effort/Schedule)  = 12.55<br />
Total Estimated Cost to Develop                           = $ 2,918,470</p>

<p>I think the main virtue of SLOCcount is that it’s an ego gratification tool for developers. “I did the work of twelve point five five people!” Etc.
