Wes Meltzer <a href="http://www.atpm.com/11.01/marsedit.shtml">reviewed MarsEdit 1.0</a> for About This Particular Macintosh. It got a “Very Nice” rating—which is nothing to sneeze at for a 1.0. And there’s some great feedback in there we can use for future development.</p>

<p>(Oh, heck, of course we wanted an “Excellent” rating—but, hey, even <a href="http://www.atpm.com/11.01/delicious-library.shtml">Delicious Library</a> got a Very Nice rating. Good company to be in.)</p>

<p>One of the things I love about the review is that it talks about <a href="http://www.bryanbell.com/">Bryan Bell’s</a> work:
</p>
<blockquote>In fact, this is one of the application’s greatest strengths. I’m no expert on iconography, though I play one on TV, but all the icons seem immediately recognizable for what they are. That’s a formidable challenge with a weblog editor, since it doesn’t have any real-life analogues, and piggy-backing off of Mail could be confusing. I am especially fond of the way the “&#8230; Weblog” command icons look: an action symbol superimposed on a Safari-esque window. And the “&#8230; Post” command icons use a sheet of paper with action symbols. It’s a very clean way of saying a lot with a little, and they make an abstract concept much more approachable.</blockquote>

I like this because it recognizes Bryan’s excellent work and also because it’s a mini-tutorial on developing toolbar icons. It’s not enough to make them attractive and clean—the use of metaphors that make sense and are consistent is a huge part of the icon designer’s art.</p>

<p>Though not an icon designer myself, I know just enough to have some small idea how wickedly difficult it can be.</p>

<p>And so not only Bryan but all the great OS X icon designers—<a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/">Jon Hicks</a>, definitely, and others whose names I don’t know—deserve our fondest thanks for helping make OS X apps usable and fun.
