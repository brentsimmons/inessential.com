Email is like TiVo for chat.</p>

<p>I’m not sure why I felt like writing that sentence, except that I’m a big fan of the “blank is like TiVo for blank” comparisons. At some point, everything is either like TiVo or like a thing being TiVo’d.</p>

<p>I sometimes enjoy making up absurd comparisons. Clouds are like TiVo for rain. Soup is like TiVo for vegetables. That kind of thing.
