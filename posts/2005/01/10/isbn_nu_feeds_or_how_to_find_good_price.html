Glenn Fleishman told me about something clever—at his site isbn.nu, you can get feeds for individual books. The feeds show prices, so you can see how much a book is at Amazon, how much at Powell’s, and so on.</p>

<p>Say you want to buy Tom Negrino’s latest book about managing your personal finances with Quicken. Since you’re smart about money (or at least hope to be), you’re looking for a good deal.</p>

<p>Here’s what you could do:</p>

<p>1. Get the ISBN number of Tom’s book. (You could search for it at <a href="http://isbn.nu/">isbn.nu</a>, look it up on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321293657/chalcedonyconsulA/ref%3Dnosim/002-9587155-5195239">Amazon</a>, etc.)</p>

<p>2. Add a new feed with a URL that looks like this: <code>http://isbn.nu/0321293657.xml</code></p>

<p>(The number part is the ISBN, which is different for each book.)</p>

<p>When a price changes, the feed is updated.</p>

<p>See? Can’t get away from TiVo comparisons.</p>

<p>My love is like a red, red TiVo. Shall I compare thee to a TiVo’s day? Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous TiVos, or to take arms against a sea of programming, and by opposing TiVo them?</p>

<p>I got TiVo on a cloudy day—when it’s cold outside, I got the month of TiVo.
