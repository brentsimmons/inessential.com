I’ve seen some reports lately of really bad behavior—freezes, lockups, non-responsive apps, etc.</p>

<p>There are two stories on MacFixIt that appear to be related:</p>

<p>I don’t really know what’s happening. What I suspect is that a networking bug is being triggered by apps that do networking—including apps such as Safari and NetNewsWire.</p>

<p>So... I bring this up just to alert folks that something’s going on here, and we’re following the issue. When we have more to report, we will.</p>
