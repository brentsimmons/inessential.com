Whenever someone complains about the Finder, someone else says, “The Finder would rock if it were rewritten in Cocoa!”</p>

<p>I feel the need to clear that up.</p>

<p>Were the Finder rewritten in Cocoa, here’s what you’d have: the Finder, only written in Cocoa. Big whoop.</p>

<p>Cocoa won’t take away the brushed metal, or make the Finder spatial, or fix the bugs, or make it faster. (It might be ever-so-slightly slower, actually.)</p>

<p>Cocoa is a wonderful framework—I use Cocoa for my software, and I totally love it. Like crazy. Madly.</p>

<p>But Cocoa can’t, on its own, fix problems with a flawed design.</p>

<p>The problem with the Finder is really a people problem: it will get fixed if and when somebody with the authority, resources, and will to fix it appears.</p>

<p>Cocoa is no magic bullet—there aren’t any magic bullets.</p>
