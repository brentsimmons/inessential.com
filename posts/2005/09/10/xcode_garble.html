<a href="http://rentzsch.com/bugs/xcodeGarble">Jonathan “Wolf” Rentzsch</a>: “And by ‘fix,’ I mean transmogrify Finder X’s source code into a soul, transfer the pneuma to a goat for purposes of physical manifestation, place said goat on top three feet of logs, twigs, shaved wood and dried leaves. Add copious and irresponsible amounts of accelerant and ignite.”
