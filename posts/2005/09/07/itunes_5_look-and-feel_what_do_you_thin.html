What do you think of the new iTunes 5.0 look-and-feel?</p>

<p>Dan Wood <a href="http://www.gigliwood.com/weblog/MacOSX/iTunes_5_is_Butt-Ug.html">does not</a> like it; drunkenbatman <a href="http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000651.html#comments">does like</a> it.</p>

<p>Some random notes, things I’ve noticed...</p>

<p>- No margins.</p>

<p>- No brushed metal. (Is brushed metal now pass&eacute;? Will iCal, iPhoto, etc. also drop brushed metal in favor of this new look?)</p>

<p>- It’s a custom window—in color <i>and</i> in shape.</p>

<p>- It is <i>not</i> the same as the new-in-Tiger unified title-and-toolbar look as seen in Mail, Dictionary, System Preferences, and other apps. It’s darker. If you compare it to a brushed-metal app, it’s about as dark. You could call it un-brushed metal. Smooth metal. (Will this become a standard look, available to developers? If so, Leopard is a long way off. Time to figure out how to duplicate it now.)</p>

<p>- The display thing at the top now does the two-tone glass thing. (Maybe it did before but I didn’t notice? Either way, that two-tone glass thing is big. Big I tell you.)</p>

<p>- The source list background color is <i>almost</i> the same as in Mail. I think it has just a smidge more red.</p>

<p>- It has another custom splitview, of course, because no two Apple apps have the same splitter. And this reinforces the 1-pixel-wide splitter as pioneered by Mail.</p>

<p>- The window corners are almost right angles. At first it reminded me of looking at a Honda Elements from behind. (Which is good or hideous, depending on your taste.)</p>

<p>- No standard configurable toolbar.</p>

<p>- The interior of the search field dims when the app is not in front, which is new (I think).</p>

<p>What do you think? Me, I don’t have a lot of opinion yet (just observations).
