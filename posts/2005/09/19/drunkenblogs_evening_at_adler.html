I’ll be in Chicago October 21 for DrunkenBlog’s <a href="http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000662.html">Evening at Adler</a>. Check out that list of developers! It should be very cool.</p>

<p>(I was born in Chicago, by the way. I didn’t grow up there, but still, I have a soft spot for Chicago.)
