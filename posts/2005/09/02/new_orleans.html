Words fail when it comes to talking about New Orleans and Biloxi and the Gulf Coast. Sheila and I are as heartbroken as everyone else watching this.</p>

<p>We donated to the <a href="http://www.redcross.org/">Red Cross</a> and to <a href="http://hsus.org/">The Humane Society</a>.</p>

<p>(You’ve probably already donated, of course. But, just in case, if anyone hasn’t, please consider this a small reminder.)
