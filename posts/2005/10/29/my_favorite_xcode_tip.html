My favorite Xcode tip is a few related tips on navigating within a file.</p>

<p>1. With a source file in front, use ctrl-2 to popup the list of functions.</p>

<p>2. Navigate the menu using the keyboardâ€”including type-ahead find.</p>

<p>3. Within your source files, use <code>#pragma mark Whatever</code> to set off sections. These appear in the popup menu in bold, making it easy to find sections.</p>

<p>(Like many, if not most, Mac developers, my goal with Xcode is to never have to touch the mouse.)
