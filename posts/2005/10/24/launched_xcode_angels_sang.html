Last Wednesday evening I launched Xcode for the first time in something like two months. It was <i>fun</i> to do actual programming.</p>

<p>(Of course, part of the hiatus was working on the deal with NewsGator and then working on the transition, which is continuing. At one point we bought a <i>fax machine</i>, even though it’s the year 2005.)</p>

<p>And tonight—Monday Oct. 24—I’m going to launch Xcode again. By the time you’re reading this, I’m programming. Cool.
