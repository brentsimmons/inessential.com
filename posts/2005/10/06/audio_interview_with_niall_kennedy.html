Yesterday Greg Reinacker and I did an <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/10/interview_with_greg_reinacker.html">audio interview with Niall Kennedy</a>. Niall had lots of great questions.</p>

<p>In the picture I look a little tired! You might imagine that the last month or so has been a whirlwind, and the wind is still whirling. (Iâ€™m still catching up on email from days ago!)</p>

<p>(Niall, by the way, is one those great human nodes who knows everybody. I think the Technorati folks are lucky to have him.)
