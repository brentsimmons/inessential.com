Last night I had the pleasure of having dinner with a couple folks from Joyent. I missed their demo earlier, but had already checked out the demos on their website: their software looks pretty cool.</p>

<p>I had dinner with David Young and John Gruber—who you know as the author of Daring Fireball. Here’s John: <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2005/10/joyent">Introducing Joyent</a>.</p>

<p>(John lives in Philadelphia, and I can hear it in his voice. For me it’s the sound of my childhood home: I grew up outside Newark, Delaware, and have family all around southeastern PA, south Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland’s eastern shore. I think about TastyKakes every day, but we don’t have them in Seattle. [In case you’re wondering, I will admit, doubly parenthetically, that every weblog post I write could eventually turn into a post about TastyKakes.])</p>

<p>So... check out <a href="http://www.joyent.com/">Joyent</a>. Also note that <a href="http://www.bryanbell.com/">Bryan Bell</a> works for them: you may recognize the feel of things from Bryan’s other work—and Bryan keeps getting better. (I was saying just last night that Bryan’s going to be a star. If he isn’t already.)
