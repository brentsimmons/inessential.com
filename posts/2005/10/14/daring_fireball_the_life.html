John Gruber writes about the economics of indie development in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2005/10/the_life">The Life</a>: “Once a developer gets enough paying users to consider quitting his day job so he can devote full-time effort to writing code, he’s quite possibly got so many paying users that he’ll spend much of his time helping customers in ways <i>other</i> than writing code.”
