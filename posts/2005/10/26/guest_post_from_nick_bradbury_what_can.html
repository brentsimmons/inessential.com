Hi folks, this is <a href="http://nick.typepad.com/">Nick Bradbury</a>,
the author of <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/index.asp">FeedDemon</a> for
Windows.  Now that Brent and I <a
href="http://inessential.com/2005/10/04.php">are</a>&nbsp;<a
href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2005/05/newsgator_acqui.html">co-workers</a>, we thought it would be a great idea to guest post on each other&#039;s blog
today as a way to introduce ourselves, and also to find out what we could
learn from each other&#039;s customers.</p>

<p>Even though I develop for Windows (and have no plans to switch), last
year I bought an iBook, motivated in large part by my desire to keep up with
all the cool features Brent was adding to NetNewsWire.  My previous
experience with the Mac was back before the OS X days, and quite honestly I
wasn&#039;t wild about it then - the lack of <a href="http://macspeedzone.com/archive/html/art/edge/misc/a/multitasking.html">preemptive multi-tasking</a> alone made me dislike it.</p>

<p>Well, as you can imagine, I was unexpectedly <a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2004/09/i_just_bought_a.html">impressed</a> with OS X.  So much so that I had this to say about it:
<blockquote>"After working with OS X for a few hours, switching back to
Windows is like partying with Charlize Theron then coming home to Kathy
Bates. Sure, Kathy Bates is exceptionally talented, but sometimes a little
glamour is exciting."</blockquote><p>Following my brief experience with OS X, I decided I could learn a lot
from Mac applications, many of which are more elegant and simpler to use
than their Windows counterparts.  And NetNewsWire is the one I&#039;ve learned
from the most - it packs an awful lot of power into a deceptively simple
UI.</p>

<p>But I don&#039;t have much experience with Mac <em>users</em>, so I&#039;m
wondering what I can learn from you?  If you use Windows as well as the Mac,
what drives you nuts about Windows apps (or, if you were <em>forced</em> to
use Windows, what would you miss the most)?  And if you&#039;ve used FeedDemon at
all, what Mac-like features do you believe it would benefit from?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
