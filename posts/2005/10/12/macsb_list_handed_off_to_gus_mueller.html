A couple years ago I had the idea for a mailing list for small, independent Macintosh software businesses. So I created a new list at Yahoo Groups and named it <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/macsb/">macsb</a>. (Which is pronounced “max-bee,” by the way, even though it doesn’t make sense to pronounce it that way.)</p>

<p>The list has been a great resource for folks—it succeeded way beyond what I expected. It has over 700 members! And it’s often quite busy, and the discussions are great.</p>

<p>If you have a small Mac software business, or are considering starting one, I recommend subscribing.</p>

<p>Now that I no longer run such a small business, I decided to turn over ownership of the list to Gus Mueller, and Gus agreed.</p>

<p>I’m sure you know Gus—but, just in case you don’t, I’ll mention that Gus runs <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/">Flying Meat</a> (Flying Meat is a reference to rock climbing), home of cool apps VoodooPad, FlySketch, and FlyGesture.</p>

<p>Thanks, Gus! I’m certain it’s in good hands and will remain a fantastic resource.</p>

<p>I’ll remain subscribed, since I do have some knowledge in this area and may have things to say from time to time. (Plus, it’s <i>fun</i>: I enjoy the discussions.) But Gus is your new Flying Meat Overlord.
