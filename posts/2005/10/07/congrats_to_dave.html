Big-time congratulations go to my former employer Dave Winer for the <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2005/10/07">weblogs.com deal</a>. Very cool!</p>

<p>I actually remember working on weblogs.com back when I was at UserLand, doing a little work, but just a littleâ€”Dave always treated it personally and specially.</p>

<p>It was a cool thing then and I hope this deal means cool things for the future of weblogs.com.
