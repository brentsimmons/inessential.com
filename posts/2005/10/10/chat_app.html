So, for my new job I have to use MSN Messenger’s chat service—but I don’t have to use the MSN Messenger app itself. (I’d rather use one app that works for various services, and, well, I don’t like brushed metal.)</p>

<p>I’m trying out Adium, and so far it seems pretty good. Other recommendations? What do you use and why?
