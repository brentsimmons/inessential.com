For most Cocoa developers the Intel switch won’t be a big problem. For our apps it’s not quite as easy as just checking a checkbox, but it shouldn’t be very difficult, either.</p>

<p>NetNewsWire, for instance, is made up of a collection of components: several frameworks, bundles, and libraries. Each separate component will have to be Intel-ified before the main executable will run Intel-native.</p>

<p>I’m guessing that, in terms of work, it will be somewhat less work than, say, adding the Bloglines subscriptions feature was. Probably 5% as much work as the syncing feature. In other words, in terms of the amount of work I expect to do, it’s a relatively minor feature.</p>

<p>So of course we plan to make our apps universal; we plan to support PowerPC and Intel.</p>

<p>Not at all developers will have it as easy, of course. Cocoa developers using Xcode are likely to have the easiest time making universal binaries.</p>

<p>I’ve heard and read some fearful reactions about the Intel thing. Here’s the deal: the Mac developers I know are professionals. They’re not going to just do PowerPC only or Intel only.</p>

<p>One of the things about independent developers is that they often do a great job of supporting a range of systems. Consider this: Safari with RSS runs only on Tiger, but NetNewsWire still runs on Jaguar. This isn’t some special case, this is normal for independent developers.</p>

<p>You might say something like, “Oh, that’s just because Apple wants to sell operating systems and independent developers want to sell to everybody, even people who don’t upgrade.”</p>

<p>To that I’d say, “Yes! You’re right! We have a very strong incentive to support different systems.” It’s just plain good business sense.</p>

<p>And, at least for the majority of Cocoa developers, this support won’t be a big deal. We already do stuff like this. In fact, supporting older operating systems is probably quite a bit more difficult.
