I’m <i>so</i> pleased to see that <a href="http://webkit.opendarwin.org/">WebKit has gone open source</a>.</p>

<p>For me, as a developer whose apps rely heavily on WebKit, this is very likely the best possible news I could have gotten at this year’s WWDC.</p>

<p>My interest is pretty simple: I want bugs in WebKit to get fixed, so my apps work better.</p>

<p>I get reports of mis-rendered pages—and reports of crashing bugs—that are WebKit bugs. My response until now has always been along the lines of, “Darn, that’s a WebKit bug, and I don’t have access to the source. If I can get some more details from you I might be able to reproduce it and report it to Apple.”</p>

<p>It’s kind of a bummer of a response, not much better than throwing my hands in the air.</p>

<p>But now my responses can be more like this: “It’s a WebKit bug. If you can send me more details, I might be able to reproduce it—and develop test cases and perhaps even fix the bug myself.”</p>

<p>This is a <i>much</i> better response. And it gives me more power over the quality of my software.</p>

<p>It means more eyeballs on WebKit, better testing, more bug fixes. So if I report a bug with a test case, and it gets fixed, then other developers benefit. If another developer reports a bug, and it gets fixed, then we benefit—and, most importantly, NetNewsWire and MarsEdit users benefit.</p>

<p>This is an example of the kind of openness that in years past we didn’t get from Apple—but these days are very different and very much better.</p>

<p>I just wanted to publicly thank the WebKit folks for doing this. Thank you!
