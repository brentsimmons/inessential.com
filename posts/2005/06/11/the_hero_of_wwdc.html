(Update 12 June 2005: this post has been edited so that no one person at Apple is singled out—teams are teams, and the entire Intel team deserves a huge round of applause.)</p>

<p>At WWDC a member of the Intel team helped me get NetNewsWire and MarsEdit building as universal binaries. It took a little under two hours. It took as long as that only because these two apps are made up of over a dozen projects, and we had to change the settings (the famous checkbox, plus some other things) and rebuild each project individually.</p>

<p>Code changes? Nope, just time spent mainly in various inspector windows in Xcode getting things set up correctly.</p>

<p>And that’s why I think this transition will be a success—because it was so easy to create universal binaries, thanks to the great work of these folks and the hands-on help they gave developers at WWDC.</p>

<p>I’m aware that for some developers the transition won’t be so smooth. But it will be smooth for a huge number of developers, and that’s an incredible achievement.
