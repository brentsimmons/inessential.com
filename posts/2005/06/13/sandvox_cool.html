At the webloggers dinner Dan Wood did some demos of <a href="http://karelia.com/">Sandvox</a>, Karelia’s upcoming web authoring app. Think “iApp for website creation” and you get the idea.</p>

<p>It’s <i>very</i> cool. (Clever name, too.) Imagine the things you would want—WYSIWYG editing, drag-and-drop, styles, RSS generation, etc.—then imagine surprises that you haven’t thought of.
