Another group at Apple that impressed me at WWDC this year was the folks behind <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/">Xcode</a>.</p>

<p>Xcode 2.0 shipped with Tiger, at the end of April. Xcode 2.1 shipped <i>less than two months later</i>.</p>

<p>It includes support for universal binaries, of course—but that’s not all, there are a bunch of nice user features in there, including a bunch of debugging improvements and a welcome change to how build settings are configured.</p>

<p>(I suspect the release of 2.1 is a combination of good planning, good project management, and possibly a few late nights.)</p>

<p>Having this new version of Xcode makes the Intel transition credible—without it, it would be all hand-waving and telling developers how it <i>will</i> be easy once the tools are ready. Better to show us, as they’ve done, that it’s <i>already</i> easy.
