The NetNewsWire private beta testers don’t mind (or at least tolerate with grace) all the user interface experiments that go on during development—and there were quite a few experiments on the road to NetNewsWire 2.0. (We like to iterate: get ideas, try them, change them, lather, rinse, repeat.)</p>

<p>At one point we were considering moving the unread count to a flush-right “chiclet.”</p>

<p>However, before we finished the feature, testers convinced me that this approach has a problem: the eye has to travel too far to associate a subscription with its number. (I could have said, “So what! Everybody else is doing it, why not NetNewsWire!” but I didn’t. Or maybe I did, but they still convinced me.)</p>

<p>Anyway, here’s a <a href="http://inessential.com/images/chiclets.png">screenshot</a> which shows my first cut at it. You can look at it and say, “Oh, I’m glad <i>that</i> didn’t ship”—but remember, this was just experimental, not intended to ship as-is, just a rough draft of an idea.</p>

<p>So then I re-did it so the chiclets were right next to the subscription name—and that wasn’t good, as you can see <a href="http://inessential.com/images/chiclets2.png">here</a>.</p>

<p>And then I thought—let’s move the numbers flush-right again, but use alternating row colors in the subscriptions, and only display a chiclet outline for the selected sub. And <a href="http://inessential.com/images/subsWithAltRows.png">that</a> didn’t really work out, either. And then <a href="http://inessential.com/images/subsWithLines.png">another version</a> had a line going from the sub name to the unread count. Arf!</p>

<p>Finally—last version—<a href="http://inessential.com/images/subsWithDots.png">dots</a>!</p>

<p>So then we figured this was enough time futzing with this particular feature, and we shelved it, to possibly revisit it later.</p>

<p>Why am I sharing this? Just for a peak behind the scenes at the development process. If you had to classify my approach to UI, you’d call me an experimenter/gatherer: try things and get feedback, then try more things. And get more feedback.</p>

<p>And now for something completely different... random old graphics found on the webserver...</p>
