I’m not writing about Apple’s user interface anymore (at least not for a while)—but I do keep seeing interesting posts by other folks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.helliferocious.com/2005/05/04/0001">Helliferocious</a> writes about an interesting new button/menu thing in the print dialog: “A buttnu?”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/posts/Thoughts/tiger-gui-discussion-2005-05-31-10-00">Quentin</a> at Rogue Amoeba writes, “Apple’s real usability expertise comes in designing end-to-end solutions like iTunes/iPod integration, or technology like Bonjour.”</p>

<p>And then Rory Prior’s <a href="http://www.thinkmac.co.uk/blog/2005/01/apples-ui-department-going-insane.html">post from last January</a> is a classic.</p>

<p>Update: here’s <a href="http://www.stolensheep.com/archives/021395.htm">Jack Shedd</a> on UI. His post reminds me how subjective this all is, and how much talking about it is a matter of emphasis.
