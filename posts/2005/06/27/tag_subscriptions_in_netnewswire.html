At Gnomedex <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/">Niall Kennedy</a> asked me if I got a lot of feedback about the Tag Subscriptions feature in NetNewsWire. I told him that no, I don’t hear about it all that often.</p>

<p>It occurs to me that people may not know about it. There were so many new features that we couldn’t really make a huge deal out of any one feature. But tag subscriptions is one of my personal favorites—I find it very useful.</p>

<p>Here’s the deal: services such as Del.icio.us, Flickr, and Technorati have pages and feeds for things that have been “tagged” with various keywords.</p>

<p>For instance, here’s the <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/gnomedex2005">Technorati page</a> for the tag <code>gnomedex2005</code>.</p>

<p>Now, if you want that page as a feed in NetNewsWire, you just do this:</p>

<p>1. Choose File > New Special Subscription > Tag...</p>

<p>2. Type <code>gnomedex2005</code> in the Tag field and choose <code>Technorati</code> from the popup menu.</p>

<p>3. Click the Subscribe button.</p>

<p>Here’s a screen shot:</p>

<p>Del.icio.us and Flickr feeds are also supported. If you like cats, you might create a Flickr tag subscription where <code>cat</code> is the tag, and you’d see everybody’s cat pictures.</p>

<p>Maybe you’re a big fan of Apache. You could create a Del.icio.us tag subscription where <code>apache</code> is the tag.</p>

<p>It’s easy, and it means you don’t have to subscribe to a million feeds to find news on topics that interest you.</p>

<p>(It’s also much like the search engine subscriptions feature, which is definitely worth checking out if you haven’t tried it. Search engines currently supported are Blogdigger, Daypop, Feedster, Findory, and Yahoo.)
