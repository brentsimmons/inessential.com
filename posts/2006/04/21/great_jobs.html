<a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bestjobs/">MONEY Magazine</a>: “MONEY Magazine and Salary.com researched hundreds of jobs, considering their growth, pay, stress-levels and other factors. These careers ranked highest.”</p>

<p>What’s highest? <i>Software engineer</i>. That means what I always suspected—that I have, and people like me have, the best job in America. ;) (I do love it, you bet.)
