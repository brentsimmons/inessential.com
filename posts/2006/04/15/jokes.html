I pointed to a Crazy Apple Rumors Site story from ranchero.com the other day: <a href="http://www.crazyapplerumors.com/?p=580">Developers To Mac Users: “Just Boot Into Windows.”</a> (There’s a fake quote from me in there—which is pretty much a guarantee of a link back from me.)</p>

<p>And then I got interview requests and people arguing with me about it. ;)</p>

<p>That’s what I get for linking to it straight, I suppose.</p>

<p>On another subject... is anyone else impressed with Niall Kennedy’s <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2006/04/recruiters-in-t.html">21 years of Java experience</a>? (The post talks about 15 years, but I added 6 because it was talking about the year 2000.)
