A bunch of crunchy screechy noises, then the folder with a question mark in it—it looks like the hard drive in my development machine is a goner.</p>

<p>It’s not an old machine, either—I just got it in February. (Or March. I forget.)</p>

<p>Anyway... having learned the lesson years ago about making backups, I only lost a couple hours of work. (The work happens to be easy to re-create, which is lucky.) Naturally I have other Macs here in the lab, so I’m not stuck.</p>

<p>But, still, sheesh, it’s a downer when your cool new machine needs to go to the shop.</p>

<p>(If there’s a lesson for anybody, it’s that making backups is a Very Good Idea. Dew eet.)
