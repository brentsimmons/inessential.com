Here’s Paul Kafasis on <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/posts/Article/It-Beats-Jamcracker-2006-04-20-10-00.html">how Rogue Amoeba got its name</a>.</p>

<p>When people ask me how Ranchero Software got its name, I wish I could tell a great story—but I can’t.</p>

<p>The year was 1997. The hot companies and products had names like Marimba, Java, Lasso, Tango—names ending in vowels, often Spanish. So we looked for a similar name ending in a vowel with an available domain name. We found ranchero.com. (And liked it.)</p>

<p>(It had nothing to do with the Adam Ant song <a href="http://www.lyricsdownload.com/adam-ant-los-rancheros-lyrics.html">Los Rancheros</a>. ;)
