<a href="http://ranchero.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=1356">NetNewsWire 2.1</a> has been released!</p>

<p>Thanks very much to everybody who helped test!</p>

<p>My favorite part of the software release process is probably writing the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire2.1.php">change notes</a>. That’s where I get to find out what I’ve actually been doing the last several months. And the change notes are rather long this time (as they often are)—which is always a good feeling.</p>

<p>The way I work is to document changes as they happen. Each version has its own change notes file. They start out as documentation for me—what I did and why, and with slight editing they become change notes for the private testers, and then they become change notes for public testers, and finally they’re consolidated as change notes for the final release.</p>

<p>In other words—what you’re reading is my development journal, just edited a little and organized.</p>

<p>I like that level of directness, that there isn’t some big layer between me sitting in front of my development machine and you reading about what’s new and different.
