I know very well how people like to see “their name in lights”—check out the NetNewsWire About box or the Sites Drawer (“Your blog in lights!”).</p>

<p>But it doesn’t happen to <i>me</i> that often that my name appears somewhere—so I was proud to see my name credited in an <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303737">Apple Security Update</a>. There’s an ImageIO bug where I get credit for reporting the issue. (CVE-ID: CVE-2006-1552: “Viewing a maliciously-crafted JPEG image may lead to arbitrary code execution.”)</p>

<p>Does it feel good? Yep!
