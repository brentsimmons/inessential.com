<a href="http://www.seattlexcoders.org/article/14/novemberdecember-schedule">Tonight’s Xcoders meeting</a> will be about <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>—<a href="http://ascarter.net/blog/">Andrew Carter</a>’s doing a presentation.</p>

<p>Though you know me as a desktop app developer, truth is, most of my career has been spent doing web apps—and I remain interested in the technology. I haven’t checked out Ruby on Rails yet, but I’ve heard how lots of people like it, and I’m definitely curious.
