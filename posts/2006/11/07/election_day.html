It’s voting day!</p>

<p>I’m a big dork about it—I always love voting, whether or not I expect to be happy with the election results.</p>

<p>Sadly, Washington state is switching to vote-by-mail—this may be the last time Sheila and I have the ritual of walking down to the local poll (a Methodist church about three blocks from here), signing in, and casting our vote. I very much like voting in person—it makes me feel connected to the tradition of voting, to the centuries of voters before me.
