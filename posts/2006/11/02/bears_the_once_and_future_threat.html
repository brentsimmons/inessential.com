CNN: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/10/30/ice.age.cave.ap/index.html">Cave an Ice Age time capsule</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote>The bear that left a 3-foot-long claw mark in an Ice Age clay bank was the largest bear species ever to walk the earth, about 6 feet tall at the shoulder and capable of moving its 1,800 pounds up to 45 miles per hour in a snarling dash for prey.</p>

<p>The claw mark by the extinct giant short-faced bear still looks fresh today in a southwest Missouri cave that some scientists are calling a national treasureâ€”an Ice Age time capsule sealed for thousands of years.</blockquote>
