<b>Five Things People Don’t Know About Me</b></p>

<p>I was tagged by <a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2006/12/five_things_peo.html">Nick</a>.</p>

<p>1. I usually wear all black at home. It matches the way I feel on the inside. ;)</p>

<p>2. The one sport at which I’m quite good, at which I can usually beat everyone in the room (unless the room contains my dad and/or brother-in-law), is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_pong">ping pong</a>.</p>

<p>3. I didn’t finish college, and didn’t take any computer science classes in college. (Had I gotten as far as declaring a major, it would have been English. I probably would have concentrated on 20th century American literature—particularly the first half of the century, the modernists.)</p>

<p>4. I play guitar and piano—with little skill but plenty of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>5. There’s a surprising amount of Public Enemy in my iTunes library.</p>
