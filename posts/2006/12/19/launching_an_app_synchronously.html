When NetNewsWire sends a news item to a weblog editor app, it sends an Apple event to that app. But first it needs to make sure the app is running, so that it can receive the Apple event.</p>

<p>When I first added this feature, I had some weird thing where NetNewsWire launched the app then waited for a notification that the app had launched—and then it would send the Apple event. It took a surprising amount of code.</p>

<p>I decided that it was okay to launch the weblog editor app synchronously. Since -[NSWorkspace launchApplication:] is async, I needed something else. Turns out it was totally easy. Given f as the path to the app:</p>

<p><pre>
LSLaunchURLSpec launchSpec;
launchSpec.appURL = (CFURLRef)[NSURL fileURLWithPath:f];
launchSpec.itemURLs = nil;
launchSpec.passThruParams = nil;
launchSpec.launchFlags = kLSLaunchAndDisplayErrors;
launchSpec.asyncRefCon = nil;
return LSOpenFromURLSpec(&launchSpec, nil);</pre></p>

<p>Anyway—so if you’re writing a newsreader or browser and need to launch a weblog editor before sending it the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/developers/externalinterface.php">post-to-weblog Apple event</a>, you can use the above code to launch the weblog editor. (Or use it for launching any app, of course.)
