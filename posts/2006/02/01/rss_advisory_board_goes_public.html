</p><blockquote><p>A new era begins today for the RSS Advisory Board, an independent organization formed in 2003 that publishes the Really Simple Syndication (RSS) specification, helps developers create RSS applications and broadens public understanding of the format.</p>

<p>The board is taking on eight new members: Meg Hourihan, Lo&iuml;c Le Meur, Eric Lunt, Ross Mayfield, Jenny Levine, Randy Charles Morin, Greg Reinacker and Dave Sifry.</p></blockquote>

I’m glad to see this happen. I was on the first iteration of this board, along with Dave Winer and Jon Udell. A larger board is probably a good idea.</p>

<p>(Note that Greg Reinacker, one of the new board members, is the founder and CTO of NewsGator, where I work.)</p>

<p>(Fans of Mac Developer Extreme Trivia(tm) will recall that I did technical editing on Rogers’ book <a href="http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/kickstart/">Radio UserLand Kick Start</a>. (The only time I ever did technical editing on a book.))
