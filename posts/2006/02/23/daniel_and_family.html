My heart goes out to Daniel Steinberg and his family on the loss of his daughter. Daniel is writing about it: <a href="http://dearelena.wordpress.com/">Dear Elena</a>.</p>

<p>In case you don’t know Daniel: he’s one of the great guys of the development world—smart and generous. My thoughts and sympathies are with him and his family.
