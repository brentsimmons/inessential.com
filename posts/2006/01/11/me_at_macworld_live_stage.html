If you’re at Macworld, you can catch me on the Macworld Live stage at 2:15 p.m. Thursday. Booth 807.</p>

<p>I’ll be on a panel with a few other Eddy winners. I don’t know if they’ll be taking questions from the audience—but I hope so! (At any rate I’ll be available after for anyone who wants to talk in person.)
