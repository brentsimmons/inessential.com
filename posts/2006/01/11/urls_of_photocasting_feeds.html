Does anyone have a URL or URLs to photocasting feeds? I’d like to see what they look like. Thanks!</p>

<p>(Note: I did try at the Apple booth to look at the source for a feed. We got the URL from iPhoto. I then went to Terminal and used curl to download it—and got an HTML page telling my browser doesn’t support it! So there must be some kind of browser detection going on. But I didn’t write down the URL to check it out later.)
