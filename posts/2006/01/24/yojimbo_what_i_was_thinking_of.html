About a year ago I was thinking about developing a note organizer app.</p>

<p>I had imagined the layout (NetNewsWire-like, as you might imagine) and some features (notes, bookmarks, web pages, search)—but of course I was just daydreaming. I may have done a quick layout in IB one night, but that’s as far as it got.</p>

<p>So here comes <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/index.shtml">Yojimbo</a>—and it’s exactly what I was thinking of. Only, well, <i>better</i>. Plenty of cool features I hadn’t thought of.</p>

<p>As a developer I can’t help thinking of apps I’d like to do but that I have no time for. It’s rare that someone else does them—so this is a happy occasion and a nice surprise. (And it’s got a place in my Dock already.)
