Whenever people ask me if I do lots of little one-off hacks, I tell them no, I don’t. Because I don’t. (No time!)</p>

<p>But a few months ago I did write, for my own personal use, a little hotkey app switcher. All the apps I use regularly can be switched to (launched if necessary) just by typing some keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<p>Purely personal software. Works for me only. Configured by editing the source code and rebuilding it.</p>

<p>And that’s how I know I’m a geek and not just a developer. (Bonus points that it’s a universal binary and runs on my DTK machine.)
