<a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/">Battlestar Galactica</a> returns tonight! I’m so there.</p>

<p>I feel like real life, in between each series, is just a dream.</p>

<p>(Okay, not really, right? Or else I’d need psychiatric help. The statement is true only in the lyric poetry sense, where hyperbole in pursuit of emotional expressiveness is true by definition rather than empirical verification.)
