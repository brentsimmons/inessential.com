<p>I had figured by now that I was the only person still using TigerLaunch—and I do use it, I like its simplicity, the flat alphabetical list of apps.</p>

<p>Were I writing it today, I’d do a number of things differently—but not everything. I still dig the non-hierarchical menu, I like that the list is alphabetical. Those things I wouldn’t change.</p>

<p>I also wouldn’t change the Projects menu, which I use more often than the apps menu. It’s how I open and switch between Xcode projects.</p>

<p>Even though I figured I was the only person still using it, it turns out I was wrong—we kept getting requests for a universal binary. And now <a href="http://ranchero.com/tigerlaunch/">here it is</a>. (Also fixed a few bugs—see the <a href="http://ranchero.com/tigerlaunch/changenotes.php">change notes</a>.)
