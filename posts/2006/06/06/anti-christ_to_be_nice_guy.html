Whenever I imagine the anti-Christ, I imagine a super nice guy, universally beloved. Well-dressed, clean-shaven—he won’t <i>look</i> like he’s from Hell.</p>

<p>He’ll be charismatic. Philanthropic. It will seem like he cares about <i>you</i>, personally. He’ll have an air of quiet moral earnestness, like Jimmy Stewart or Gregory Peck.</p>

<p>If he makes something (movies, software, soft drinks, shoes) people will love his products. If he’s a politician he will be loved by left and right.</p>

<p>You won’t know he’s the anti-Christ. In fact, he would be the last guy you suspect.</p>

<p>He’ll have a wonderful speaking voice, and you’ll just love to listen to him talk. Everybody will.
