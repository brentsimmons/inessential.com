So those Leopard screenshots are faked. <a href="http://trinityrubicon.blogspot.com/2006/06/jig-is-up.html">Trinity Rubicon: The jig is up...</a>.</p>

<p>This part almost made me spit out my coffee—or, at least, nod knowingly: “Then, I went back into Photoshop and cleared the black area Fun House creates from the distortion and put a fake second desktop underneath it. <i>Sure, it looks cheesy, but if Apple made it, something tells me you would like it</i>.” (Emphasis mine.)</p>

<p>It’s funny because it’s <i>true</i>. I was all getting into it, thinking it was cool, and then I found out it was fake, and then I thought it looked cheesy. Is there no hope for us Mac users?
