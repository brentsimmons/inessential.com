<img src="http://inessential.com/images/unifiedToolbarSeparatorLine.png" alt="screenshot of unified toolbar" height="349" width="679" /></p>

<p>This is a screenshot of two screenshots blown up to 500%. They’re taken from Mail, but they could be of any unified title and toolbar app.</p>

<p>The difference is probably obvious: the one behind has a light (54%) line under the toolbar, where the one in front has a darker (35%) line.</p>

<p>You can reproduce it fairly easily—just hide then show the toolbar in any unified app that uses NSToolbar. You’ll get the darker line.</p>

<p>Then click on the desktop then click back on the window with the toolbar in question—the line will go back to being light.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to work around this?
