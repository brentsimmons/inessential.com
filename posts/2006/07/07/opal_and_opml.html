Since I’m a long-time outliner user, I downloaded <a href="http://a-sharp.com/opal/">Opal</a>, a new outliner from the folks who brought us Acta. It’s obvious that it’s in an early stage of development, but it’s also fun to use, with a nice focus on the core features, which is exactly what you want to see at this stage.</p>

<p>I checked the About box, as I always do when I check out a new app—since the About box is kind of like a social networking thing. (Who’s in there? Who do I know?)</p>

<p>And I was surprised to see my name in there as someone being thanked, and I didn’t know why—then it hit me what it had to be: my bet was that Opal imports OPML files and the OPML code is probably based on some OPML code I released a few years ago.</p>

<p>Sure enough! A quick class-dump confirmed it.</p>

<p>You have no idea how gratifying that is. (Or, maybe, if you’re a developer, you <i>do</i> have some idea.) I love it when other developers find my code useful and incorporate it into something cool. That totally made my day.</p>

<p>(I also find it cool that, even in this early stage of development, Opal already supports OPML. I was able to export my subscriptions from NetNewsWire and open the file in Opal. Nice.)
