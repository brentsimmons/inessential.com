I can admit it—I’m addicted to <a href="http://rockstar.msn.com/">Rock Star: Supernova</a>.</p>

<p>Last night I thought they should have dropped Patrice. She smiles way too much, and she looks a little like Maria Cantwell. (Who I like as a senator but probably not so much as a rock star.)</p>

<p>I’m pulling for Dilana, of course. She’s pure magic. But I like Toby and Magni quite a bit too.
