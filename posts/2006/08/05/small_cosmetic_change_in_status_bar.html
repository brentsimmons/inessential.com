It might be kind of silly to make <i>any</i> cosmetic changes right before WWDC—and I leave open the possibility that I’ll reverse the following change or change it again.</p>

<p>NetNewsWire 2.1:</p>

<p>NetNewsWire 3.0d7:</p>

<p>I’ve been working toward making NetNewsWire higher-contrast. The trend (as I’ve written about recently) is to make the control areas at the top and bottoms of windows dark, to contrast better with the content area.</p>

<p>So NetNewsWire’s status bar went from the glass look to a darker gradient. I think it fits in better with the unified title-and-toolbar window style. (I could have made it even darker, but then it wouldn’t have fit with the window style.)</p>

<p>But... will we get new or changed window styles at WWDC? Will we see a new convention for status bars? I don’t know! There’s an excellent chance that what we’ll see this week will affect the look of NetNewsWire and lots of other apps.
