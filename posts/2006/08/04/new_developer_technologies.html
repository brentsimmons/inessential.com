I wonder if there will be new developer technologies at this WWDC as important as Cocoa Bindings and Core Data in recent years.</p>

<p>I don’t think so—which doesn’t bother me at all, actually. I do expect new technologies, and I expect improvements to Bindings and Core Data, but I don’t expect big new fundamental technologies like these.</p>

<p>My reasoning is pretty simple. Cocoa apps are generally built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. Back in the early days of OS X we already had View technologies, but not much for Model and Controller. Then Cocoa Bindings came along, which covered the Controller part. A year later Core Data appeared, which covered the Model (data) part.</p>

<p>So we’re covered (M, V, and C) and I don’t expect fundamental new developer technologies.</p>

<p>But of course I stand ready to be surprised by things I didn’t think of!
