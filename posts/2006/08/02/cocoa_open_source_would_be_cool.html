@title Cocoa open source would be cool

Here’s something I’d totally love to see at WWDC: the Cocoa framework open-sourced. Foundation and AppKit both.</p>

<p>It’s not that I want to work on it, and it’s not that I want to use _undocumented _private _methods, it’s that sometimes it would be really helpful to have the source so I can see what’s going on under the hood.</p>

<p>There are times when things don’t work as expected, or there’s some weird bug, and I want to look at the source—and be able to <i>debug</i> with the source—so I can see what the heck is actually going on.</p>

<p>I understand entirely that making Cocoa open source means a bunch of work. It wouldn’t be easy; it would be expensive. But Apple does have the WebKit experience to draw on.</p>

<p>And there are other drawbacks. But one drawback I think doesn’t exist: they don’t have to worry about competition. Is there somebody else who wants to create an Objective-C application framework for OS X? (Ah, nope.)</p>

<p>Apple would get big points for openness and generosity and developer support. (Assume that part of this would be making the bug tracker open to developers.)</p>

<p>(I have absolutely no inside knowledge. This would be an exciting and cool thing to have happen, but I put its likelihood somewhere around 0.01%.)
