In no particular order, here are some random guesses about things we might see at WWDC (not all of which may be public, of course):</p>

<p>- The end of Sherlock. (Probably wouldn’t be announced—we’d just discover it’s missing when we install Leopard.)</p>

<p>- Safari with sidebar/source-list thing. I’m not sure what it would do, I just have a hunch it’ll be there. Consider all the widescreen monitors these days.</p>

<p>- Steve Jobs telling us about the great reaction to the “I’m a <strike>trust-fund POS</strike> Mac, I’m a PC” commercials.</p>

<p>- Tabbed Finder. Will it really be better, or the same thing with tabs? At least the brushed metal will be replaced with iApp smooth metal. (Surely. If not, I’ll be very surprised.)</p>

<p>- Dashcode.</p>

<p>- Way faster compile times. (Okay, I’m totally dreaming. But I can hear Jobs’ voice talking about how Apple engineers worked with the gcc engineers to something-something-performance-something. Please let it be so!)</p>

<p>- Something Intel-ish. Something Mac-first and Intel-ish.</p>

<p>- Garbage freaking collection for Cocoa apps. (Which I actually don’t care about personally, but I’ll believe you if you say it’s a good thing.)</p>

<p>- News that Apple has acquired Parallels. (“We liked it so much we bought the company, and now Macs are the best computers for running Windows, even Vista—once it eventually ships.”)</p>

<p>- Kitty cats.
