It seemed futuristic to me. Maybe it’s old hat, but to me it was new and cool.</p>

<p>I was getting a crown on one of my wisdom teeth the other day (ugh, don’t think about it)—but, during the procedure, I got to wear a pair of goggles of some kind <i>with a TV screen inside it</i>!</p>

<p>Very cool.</p>

<p>I had a pick of several movies: I chose Life of Brian, which I’d seen many times before, like every geek. I figured it would be the equivalent of going to my happy place. (It was.)</p>

<p>“What Jesus clearly fails to appreciate is that it’s the meek who are the <i>problem</i>.”</p>

<p>“Centuwion, why do they tittew so?”</p>

<p>That was tooth #17. I have to go back for tooth #32. I’m thinking of bringing in my own copy of Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
