I love to delete code. It’s the best thing about programming.</p>

<p>But, of course, I’m working on a new version of NetNewsWire that has a big new feature plus some smaller new features. So I’ve written a bunch of <i>new</i> code.</p>

<p>Well, I got curious as to how I was doing on number of lines of code—and found that, at least so far, NetNewsWire 2.1 has 5750 <i>fewer</i> lines of code than NetNewsWire 2.0.1. (This includes the various frameworks I wrote that NetNewsWire uses.)</p>

<p>How could this be?</p>

<p>The first thing is, the Notepad has finally been removed. (There’s a good chance you have no idea what I’m talking about. It was a 1.x feature that nobody used. It was hidden for 2.0: it could only be turned on via a Terminal command. And now it has finally been removed.)</p>

<p>The second thing is that NetNewsWire 2.1 requires 10.3.9 or greater—which means two sub-things:</p>

<p>a. I could delete Jaguar-specific code.</p>

<p>b. I could switch to using Cocoa bindings in a bunch of places (most notably in the preferences window) which allowed me to delete a ton of code.</p>

<p>And the third thing is just that, like any programmer, I get better over time and find ways to make my code smaller and better. This part is actually my favorite—when I realize I can do in five lines what I used eight lines to do—and not only that, it’s more readable and easier to maintain.</p>

<p>I have a thing about this deleting-code thing. (You might recall how, for the 2.0 release, we split the weblog editor out into a separate app. This continues that tradition.)</p>

<p>Of course, the actual app folder will probably be bigger than 2.0.1—since this version includes both PowerPC and Intel compiled code and has some new resources (new windows, graphics, etc.).</p>

<p>But—<i>fewer lines of code</i>.
