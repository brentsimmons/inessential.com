Niall Kennedy: <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2006/03/feed-platform-p.html">Feed platform presentation: Microsoft, Google, and NewsGator</a>: “I will lead a session on Feeds as a Platform at the Emerging Technology conference tomorrow at 1:45 p.m. I will talk about the feed ecosystem, peer into the future a bit, and introduce attendees to three real-world examples of feed platforms.”</p>

<p>I’ll be there! In fact, I’ll be speaking for ten minutes or so about syncing (with a little demo of the latest beta of NetNewsWire).
