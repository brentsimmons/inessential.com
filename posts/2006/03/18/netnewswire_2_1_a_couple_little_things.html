Here are a couple small features added to NetNewsWire 2.1 that you may not have noticed...</p>

<p></p></p>

<p><h4>Select News Items Tab</h4></p>

<p><p>Sometimes you’re looking at a web page tab and you want to get back to the News Items tab.</p>

<p>With 2.0, you had a choice: either click the tab with your mouse or navigate to it, one tab at a time, via select-next or select-previous tab keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<p>Now you can get there fast: just type cmd-\\.</p>

<p>(The command appears in the Window menu, under the other tab commands—but it’s really a keyboard shortcut kind of thing.)</p>

<p></p></p>

<p><h4>60-Day Dinosaurs coloring in the subscriptions list</h4></p>

<p><p></p>

<p>The dinosaurs feature is cool, but you have to remember to use it. We added one simple little feature: any feed that hasn’t updated in 60 days is now colored brown.</p>

<p>You can change the color, of course: choose <span class="menuPath">View > Show Color Options</span>.</p>

<p>(Obviously, there’s plenty more to do regarding feed management! But still, even this little thing is useful.)</p>

<p></p></p>

<p><h4>Colors window, other colors</h4></p>

<p><p>Colors used to be in the preferences window, but it used a popup menu and a single color control.</p>

<p>The problems with that:</p>

<p>1. It made it hard to see all the things you could color.</p>

<p>2. You couldn’t look at your entire color scheme at a glance to get an idea if it all went together.</p>

<p>3. You couldn’t drag-and-drop from one color control to another (since there was only one).</p>

<p>Hence the new Colors window. (It’s almost no lines of code, by the way—thanks to the magic of Cocoa bindings.)</p>

<p>In addition to 60-day dinosaurs, mentioned above, you can now also color subscriptions with 0 unread items, read headlines, and followed headlines. (“Followed” means you opened the web page for that headline.)</p>

<p>That means, yes, you can go <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw2.1beta/crazyColors.png">nuts</a>.
