A few people have told me that NetNewsWire is weird that option-upArrow goes to the top of the subscriptions list and option-downArrow goes to the bottom.</p>

<p>The standard is to use cmd, not option, right?</p>

<p>That’s what I thought too—so I went looking in my code for where I implemented this to see if I had left a comment or something to explain it.</p>

<p>But—it’s not anywhere in my code. It turns out that it’s part of the default behavior of NSTableView and NSOutlineView objects. option-upArrow goes to the top, option-downArrow goes to the bottom.</p>

<p>Who knew? I thought it was weird, too, but it’s correct. (For other examples, check out Safari’s and Camino’s bookmarks list.)
