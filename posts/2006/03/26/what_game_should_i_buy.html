For Christmas I got a PlayStation Portable and Star Wars Battlefront II.</p>

<p>Now I’m thinking I might like a new game for my birthday. What game should I get?</p>

<p>I prefer <i>flying</i> (spaceships, mainly, but also airplanes) to just running around. (I’ve already got a body in real life: I don’t know why I’d want a virtual one. What I don’t have in real life is a <i>super-fast spaceship with lasers</i>.)
