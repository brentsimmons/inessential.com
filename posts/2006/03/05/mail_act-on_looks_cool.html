People have been pointing me to <a href="http://www.indev.ca/MailActOn.html">Mail Act-On</a>, which looks quite cool and useful. It sounds like it would solve some of the reasons why I can’t use Mail.</p>

<p>(But not all of them, unfortunately. I say “unfortunately” because I’d love to switch away from Entourage. In fact, sometimes I use mutt+BBEdit for a few hours just to give myself a break from Entourage. I even have a codeless language module for email in BBEdit that works pretty well.)
