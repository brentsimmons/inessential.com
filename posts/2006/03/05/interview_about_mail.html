A brief <a href="http://www.timgaden.com/hawkwings/2006/03/06/talking-mailapp-brent-simmons/">interview</a> with me about Mail appears on the Hawk Wings weblog. (It’s part of a series of interviews: check out the archives.)</p>

<p>The world of email clients amazes me. I’m less happy with my email app in 2006 than I was using Eudora on System 7 back in 1996.
