I don’t mind admitting that it surprised me, and continued to surprise me, and <i>kept</i> surprising me, every time a person asked for a Print command in NetNewsWire.</p>

<p>The thing is, this was one of the most common feature requests.</p>

<p>It’s just that, in this Web two-point-oh world, this universe of podcasting and aggregating, who prints? The answer, it turns out, is: lots of folks.</p>

<p>Well, then, right on. So we added a Print command.</p>

<p>It prints either the current description or the current web page (whichever is in front). It’s standard—you can do the normal thing to make a PDF, all that stuff.</p>
