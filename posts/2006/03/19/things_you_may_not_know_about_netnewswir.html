Here are some things you may not know about NetNewsWire... These apply to 2.0 and 2.0.1, even, not just the public beta.</p>

<p>(I like to write this kind of post now and again because I find, based on the questions we get, that there are things you may not know but that could be helpful.)</p>
<h4>Find command</h4>
<p>
Say you’re looking at a web page, or want to find something in the Sites Drawer or in the subscriptions list. Just type cmd-F. Or choose <span class="menuPath">Edit > Find > Find...</span>.
</p>
<h4>Easy shortcuts</h4>
<p>
There are a bunch of keyboard shortcuts that don’t require the cmd key. Choose <span class="menuPath">Help > Keyboard Shortcuts</span> to see the list.
</p>
<h4>Go to top and bottom of subscriptions list</h4>
<p>
When the subscriptions list has focus, you can go to the top item by typing option-upArrow. To go to the bottom item, type option-downArrow.
</p>
<h4>Cycle info display below subscriptions</h4>
<p>The text at the bottom left corner of the main window, right below the subscriptions list, can be cycled. Just click on it to display a different piece of information. Click again. (Etc.)
</p>
<h4>Feed Validation</h4>
<p>
If a feed isn’t working for some reason, you can validate it using the online feed validator. Select the feed and choose <span class="menuPath">Validate this Feed</span> from the gear menu below the subscriptions list.
</p>
<h4>Turn off dock icon unread count</h4>
<p>
You can completely turn off the unread count in the dock. Open the Preferences window and uncheck the box next to <span class="uiname">Show unread count</span>.
</p>
<h4>Colorize dock icon unread count</h4>
<p>
You can change the colors of the dock icon unread count—both the background and the text. It doesn’t have to be white-on-red!
</p>
<h4>Resources online</h4>
<p>There are a bunch of pages and feeds with all kinds of <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/resources/">resources</a>: <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/resources/scripts.php">scripts</a> and <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/resources/styles.php">stylesheets</a> written by NetNewsWire users, <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/resources/tips.php">tips</a>, and so on.
</p>
<h4>Open tabs in the background</h4>
<p>
When NetNewsWire opens a new tab, it can do so in the background—that is, it doesn’t have to switch to the new tab.</p>

<p>Open the Preferences window, click the <span class="uiname">Browsing</span> icon, then uncheck the box next to <span class="uiname">Select new tabs as they are created</span>.</p>

<p>I myself always have NetNewsWire open tabs in the background, because it suits my personal reading style, which is to go through news items, opening tabs as I go, then go through the tabs that I opened.</p>

<p>(Not that everybody has to read news this way! That’s just how I do it.)
</p>
<h4>Datelines/summaries in headlines table</h4>
<p>
Especially useful for widescreen users: you can show datelines, summaries, or both in the headlines table.</p>

<p>See the <span class="menuPath">View > Layout</span> menu. If you show datelines, then you don’t have to deal with the smaller amount of room for columns.
</p>
<h4>Dinosaurs</h4>
<p>
If you want to see which of your feeds haven’t updated in a while, choose <span class="menuPath">Window > Dinosaurs</span>.
</p>
<h4>See all new items at once, see all flagged items at once</h4>
<p>
Check out these two commands, both from the View menu:</p>

<p><span class="menuPath">Show New Items Subscription</span><br />
<span class="menuPath">Show Flagged Items Subscription</span>
</p>
<h4>Search engine and tag subscriptions</h4>
<p>
If you want to subscribe to keyword searches and tag feeds, you can: choose <span class="menuPath">File > New Special Subscription > Search Engine...</span> and <span class="menuPath">File > New Special Subscription > Tag...</span>.</p>

<p>These are highly useful for me personally, since there’s no way I can subscribe to the entire blogosphere, but I do want to get feedback about my software that people post.
</p>
<h4>Help Book</h4>
<p>
NetNewsWire has a manual: choose <span class="menuPath">Help > NetNewsWire Help</span>.
