I’m working on NetNewsWire Lite, so we can do a beta soon.</p>

<p>I happened to go the website and noticed something I’d forgotten—which is that we still distribute a version of NetNewsWire Lite (1.0.2) that <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/prejaguar.php">runs on pre-Jaguar</a> systems.</p>

<p>Whatever you do, <i>do not run it</i>. It doesn’t know about newer features, and it will for sure mess up your prefs and data. 100% guaranteed, bad things.</p>

<p>Since I know what I’m doing, though, I could run it and see if it still launches, so many OS versions later.</p>

<p>Guess what? It works fine. (Hats off to Apple engineers!)</p>
