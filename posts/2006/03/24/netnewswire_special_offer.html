We’re running a special sale on NetNewsWire: until NetNewsWire 2.1 ships, you can buy NetNewsWire for $5 off, for <a href="http://ranchero.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=1327">just $19.95</a>. Or you can buy the NetNewsWire/MarsEdit bundle for just $29.95, which is an even better deal.</p>

<p>People sometimes ask me—“When’s the best time to buy NetNewsWire, now or when 2.1 ships?”</p>

<p>The answer is: “Hey, we’re running a sale right now!”
