<a href="http://ussmariner.com/2006/03/12/bugs-bunny-greatest-banned-player-ever/">U.S.S. Mariner</a>: “Almost as baffling is Bunny’s ‘slow ball.’ Traveling a straight line and barely rotating, it moves so little that three batters take three swings at it and never make contact. Given the ball’s extremely minimal rotation, it seems likely that this is not a ‘slow ball’ as we conventionally think of it but instead a knuckleball, which Bunny is using to best take advantage of the known unusual air currents at the Polo Grounds.”
