With this issue I used to just worry about my friends shipping their apps. Now I worry about the entire ecosystem. Mobile apps require syncing.

There are three things Apple could have done:

1. Not provided a syncing system.

2. Provided a syncing system.

3. Provided a syncing system that doesn’t work.

Of all the options, #3 is the worst, because it leads developers down a bad path, and because it makes users expect developers to use that syncing system.
