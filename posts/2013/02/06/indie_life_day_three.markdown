It’s day three of sitting at my computer as a returned-to-indie-life developer. Here’s what I’ve noticed so far:

* I get eight hours of sleep.
* My calendar is suddenly very much *not full*. There are many expanses of days with nothing on them. (No meetings; nothing about when co-worker X is going on vacation.)
* I *still* have trouble writing code until after dinner. I think this may be a temperament issue more than a scheduling issue.
* But I’m enjoying writing code more than I have in a long time.
* And I’m super relaxed. Zaphod-level relaxed. I chalk this up to happiness.
