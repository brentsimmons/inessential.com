The last time I was an indie developer was 2002-2005. It’s interesting (to me, at least) to note what’s new since then. A partial list:

* iPhone
* iPad
* App Stores
* Twitter
* Facebook
* git, Mercurial; GitHub, Bitbucket
* Stack Overflow
* The podcast renaissance
* Dropbox

It’s not like I was asleep the whole time, but I do feel a bit like a Rip Van Winkle. (I also <a href="https://twitter.com/brentsimmons/status/299230615109246976">feel like a Pappy Van Winkle</a>.)

There’s never been a better time to be an indie developer.
