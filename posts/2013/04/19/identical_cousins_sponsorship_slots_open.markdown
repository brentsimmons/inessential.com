We have some sponsorship slots open for future episodes of <a href="http://identicalcousins.net">Identical Cousins</a>, the podcast I do with Michael Simmons.

If you might be interested, contact me or Michael. (There’s Twitter info on the site. Or you can email me using brent plus the domain name of the business I own.)

Past sponsors have included <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/ios">Windows Azure Mobile Services</a>, <a href="http://www.fastspring.com/">FastSpring</a>, and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pinbook-for-pinboard/id564452716?mt=8">Pinbook</a>. You’d be in great company.
