The <a href="http://www.chromium.org/blink">Blink fork of WebKit</a> has me wondering about Apple’s and Google’s tactics.

Specifically, I think back to Google’s <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html">recent spring cleaning</a>, where it said that the CalDAV API will be available for whitelisted developers only.

I wonder if Apple will be on that whitelist.
