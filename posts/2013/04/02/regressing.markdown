>Google Alerts, Delicious and RSS were designed in blogging’s early days as innovations to help readers reduce this noise—to help improve their reading experience. But now those gains are disappearing. I feel that the tech press has allowed this to happen.

I had not realized that <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/21/google-alerts-broken-useless-and-slowed-to-a-trickle/">Google Alerts was having problems</a>. But it doesn’t surprise me.

I wonder if it will go away on the same day as Feedburner, or whether the two will succumb in separate clean-outs.
