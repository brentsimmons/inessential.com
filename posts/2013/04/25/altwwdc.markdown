WWDC sold out in three minutes. (Or less.) I didn’t manage to get a ticket, though I did try.

I have a feeling that <a href="http://altwwdc.com/">AltWWDC</a> is gonna be huge this year. (I’ll be there — I’m <a href="http://altwwdc.com/speakers/">speaking</a>. I’d be there even if I weren’t.)

It was only a few years ago when WWDC didn’t sell out at all. It even had Early Bird pricing.
