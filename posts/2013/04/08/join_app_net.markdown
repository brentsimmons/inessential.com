I have a whole bunch of invitations to App.net — <a href="https://join.app.net/from/simmons">you can sign up here</a>.

If you don’t know much about App.net, check out the <a href="http://blog.app.net">weblog</a>, where they promote third-party apps, link to their podcast, and talk about the APIs they’re building. It would be wrong to call it a Twitter alternative — it’s very much its own thing, and worth checking out.

I’m a fan. Love the vibe. I’m <a href="https://alpha.app.net/brentsimmons">@brentsimmons</a> there.
