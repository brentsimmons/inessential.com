Small Picture, Dave Winer’s new company, <a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/april/introducingFargo">introduced Fargo today</a>. It’s an outliner that runs in your browser and saves to Dropbox. The file format is OPML, so you can edit those documents in other apps (such as <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnioutliner/">OmniOutliner</a>) that support OPML.
