At the upcoming <a href="http://seattlexcoders.org/">Seattle Xcoders meeting</a> — Thursday, Oct. 10 at UW — I’ll be talking about Vesper.

I asked <a href="https://twitter.com/halm">Hal Mueller</a>, Xcoders organizer, who suggested the topic, if I should just do tech or just the squishy bits, or if I should mix it up.

Hal said, “I’d say mix it up, and don’t skimp on the squishy bits.”

So. There will be squishy bits.
