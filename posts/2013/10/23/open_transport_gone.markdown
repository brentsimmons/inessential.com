Some of you will be surprised to hear that Open Transport was included through OS X 10.8. Most of you probably have no idea what Open Transport is (was). (It was a set of [flexible, stream-based networking APIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Transport) from the pre-OS-X era.)

<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/releasenotes/MacOSX/WhatsNewInOSX/Articles/MacOSX10_9.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013207-CH100">Whatâ€™s New in OS X</a> lists some removed APIs: Open Transport, Power management (Power.h), Message.framework, ServerNotification.framework.

This affects almost nobody. But it does affect some people.

Newly-deprecated: InstantMessage.framework, Quicktime.framework, QTKit.framework. (Superseded by Social.framework and AVKit and AVFoundation.)
