>I write and code in a corner office in my home, with two big windows, a skylight, and three giant Boeing surplus desks — earthquake-proof, I’d bet — arranged in a U shape. The desks are clean but not obsessively so.

P.S. It’s actually four Boeing surplus desks. My strengths apparently do not include *counting*.
