David Brin, <a href="http://www.salon.com/1999/06/15/brin_main/">writing in Salon in 1999</a>:

>No wonder George Lucas publicly yearns for the pomp of mighty kings over the drab accountability of presidents. Many share his belief that things might be a whole lot more vivid without all the endless, dreary argument and negotiating that make up such a large part of modern life.

>If only someone would take command. A leader.
