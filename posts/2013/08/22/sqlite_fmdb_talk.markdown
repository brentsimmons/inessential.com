I’ll be speaking at <a href="http://360idev.com/">360iDev in Colorado</a> on using SQLite and FMDB as an alternative to Core Data. I’ll begin with why you might want to do this — *and* why you should probably stick with Core Data — and then I’ll go into how. Juicy technical details.

I’ve been using SQLite since before Core Data existed, since the days when SQLite didn’t even ship on Macs. (I compiled my own version of SQLite 2.x in those days.)

I’ve shipped apps that use Core Data and shipped other apps that don’t. My most recent apps, [Glassboard](http://glassboard.com/) and [Vesper](http://vesperapp.co/), use SQLite + FMDB solely.
