I was talking to Chris Parrish about how Mail and other applications often apply some resistance when you pan a table view cell. It seemed like *math* might be involved, and I wondered how to do it. (Chris is good at figuring out these things.)

So today Chris posted <a href="https://github.com/twenty3/Resistance">Resistance</a> on GitHub.

Chrisâ€™s insight: forget the math. Just use a UIScrollView, which already has resistance built-in. Smart!
