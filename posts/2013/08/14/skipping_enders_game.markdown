Ender’s Game might be a good movie. But I won’t watch it.

I can’t get past <a href="http://www.ornery.org/essays/warwatch/2013-05-09-1.html">Orson Scott Card’s nuttiness</a>. Here he is on how Obama could install Michelle Obama as his successor — via the use of brown shirts:

>Where will he get his “national police”? The NaPo will be recruited from “young out-of-work urban men” and it will be hailed as a cure for the economic malaise of the inner cities.

>In other words, Obama will put a thin veneer of training and military structure on urban gangs, and send them out to channel their violence against Obama's enemies.

>Instead of doing drive-by shootings in their own neighborhoods, these young thugs will do beatings and murders of people “trying to escape” — people who all seem to be leaders and members of groups that oppose Obama.

I don’t want to do anything that might benefit Card.

He makes sure to say that he’s just kidding and it’s all fiction. But that doesn’t mean he isn’t feeding racism and the paranoid style — he is.
