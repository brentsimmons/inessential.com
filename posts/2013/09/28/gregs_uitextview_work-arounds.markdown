A few days ago Greg Pierce — who I’ve known since my days at UserLand, who writes <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a> — sent me email letting me know he’d published a <a href="https://gist.github.com/agiletortoise/a24ccbf2d33aafb2abc1">gist with some UITextView text selection work-arounds</a>.

We’re using that code in the version of Vesper that appeared on the App Store yesterday.

So far so good. It definitely helps. Many thanks to Greg.
