After writing my article about <a href="http://www.objc.io/issue-4/SQLite-instead-of-core-data.html">SQLite + FMDB</a> for objc.io, I thought about generalizing my database code and releasing it on GitHub.

But now there’s no need: see <a href="https://github.com/marcoarment/FCModel">FCModel by Marco Arment</a>.

(My code and Marco’s code are different, but the approach we take is so similar — probably necessarily so — that a second implementation wouldn’t make sense.)
