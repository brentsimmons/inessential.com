He doesn’t mention Xcode, but one of the things I like about working with Dave is that he knows his way around Xcode. It’s Dave, not me, who handles getting builds to beta testers and uploading to the App Store. Dave adds his graphics to the project. He even changes the version number.

Yup, I’ve got it pretty easy.
