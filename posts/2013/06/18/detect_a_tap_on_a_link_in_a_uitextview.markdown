Vesper’s detail view is a UITextView. When the keyboard is down, URLs inside the UITextView are tappable.

I’d done just a little work with UITextView in the past. Though I’d seen UITextRange and UITextPosition in the headers, I had no idea how these things worked. So I figured it out.

I published the <a href="https://gist.github.com/brentsimmons/5810992">code as a gist</a>. You can probably improve the code. If you do, <a href="https://twitter.com/brentsimmons">let me know</a>.

Still to do: figure out how to highlight the link on tap.
