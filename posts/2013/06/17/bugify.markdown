For Vesper we use <a href="http://lighthouseapp.com/">Lighthouse</a> — which I like a lot. But I got email from Robert Kern at <a href="https://bugify.com/">Bugify</a>, which I hadn’t heard of — and, judging by the website and screen shots, it looks worth checking out.

While we don’t plan to switch, I do recommend checking it out if you’re looking for a bug tracker. (It has an <a href="https://bugify.com/api">API</a>.)
