My friends at Black Pixel have released an <a href="http://blackpixel.com/blog/2013/06/netnewswire-4-open-beta.html">open beta for NetNewsWire 4 for Mac</a>. It’s free during the beta period.

I downloaded it. I’m using it. I’m excited.

It’s weird to help test an app I used to work on — especially <em>this</em> app. But it’s fun.

<em>Update:</em> I bought it. It’s half-off, just $10, during the beta. No-brainer.
