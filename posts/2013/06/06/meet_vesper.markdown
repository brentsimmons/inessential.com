I’m especially proud of the work my co-workers Dave Wiskus and John Gruber did. I had the privilege and fun of making their designs real.

I started working on it in early February. John and Dave had a head-start on the design. It’s been an intense several months of coding and iteration, and I’m really happy to be able to present it to you now.

Of all the software I’ve ever made, just two were lovable from the moment I started writing code. This is one of them.
