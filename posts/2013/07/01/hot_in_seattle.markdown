My weather widget tells me to expect 88 degrees for four hours today. Which is hot, sure, but not 100 degrees hot.

The thing about Seattle, though, is that air conditioning is rare. My house is surrounded by trees, so it’s relatively cool inside (in the 70s) — but other people are feeling every degree of this heat.
