In [Still Number One](http://identicalcousins.net/2013/11/05/identical_cousins_23) Michael and I talk about the successful launch of [Fantastical 2](http://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone) (which is good; you should get it). And we talk about such diverse topics as being Sherlocked, arcade games, the Red Sox, and talking on airplanes (which you shouldn’t ever do under any circumstances).

Along the way, Michael mentioned an interesting development trick.

Fantastical 2 is a new app, but they didn’t want that thing where a new app means you lose all your preferences and have to set up everything all over again.

So what they did is have both versions of Fantastical share a keychain, and they had Fantastical 1 store a copy of some of the preferences in the keychain. Then Fantastical 2 read those preferences back from the keychain — and there you go. No need to set it up again. Nice.
