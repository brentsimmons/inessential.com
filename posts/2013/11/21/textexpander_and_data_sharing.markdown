[MacStories reports that TextExpander touch needs to be revised](http://www.macstories.net/linked/textexpander-touch-to-be-revised-significantly-following-apple-rejection/) because it’s sharing data with apps via a special Reminder. (Which is a hack, obviously, but it was needed because the previous method, a shared clipboard, was shut down by Apple.)

I would love to see a supported means of sharing data between apps on iOS. I’d love to see something like AppleScript ([only much, much better](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2A_nW6E5aQ)).

In the absence of that, the only non-hacky way of sharing data is a web service. Our friends at [Smile](http://www.smilesoftware.com/) want to publish a new SDK by Monday, and there’s no time to create a web service between now and then. I understand their needing an expedient solution right away. Nevertheless, I would advise switching over to a web service as soon as possible afterward.
