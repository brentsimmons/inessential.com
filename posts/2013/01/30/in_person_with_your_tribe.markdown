I like this blog post that Matt Alexander wrote after <a href="http://one37.net/blog/2012/1/29/people.html">his first Macworld last year</a>.

>Twenty or thirty minutes after meeting some of my favorite writers, we were sprinting across a train platform like it was normal. Hours (<em>hours</em>) later we were sitting on the Cupertino campus, chatting about life, kids, and technology. On the train home, I opened Instagram and saw that Shawn Blanc had posted a picture of Ben Brooks and I. Perhaps this all sounds very run of the mill to you, but it was truly explosive to me.
