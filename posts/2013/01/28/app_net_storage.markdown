The Verge: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/28/3924352/app-net-adds-dropbox-twitter-with-10gb-storage-data-API">App.net adds storage</a>:

>You can think of it like iCloud or Dropbox with a social layer — a central place to store and share files across platforms and service silos — or you can think of it as free hosting for services that want to build photo-sharing, group-messaging, or Pinterest-like web applications using App.net’s login. In fact, App.net founder Dalton Caldwell said in an interview, a developer could bundle all of these services together and build a near-clone of Facebook.

I like the emphasis on privacy.
