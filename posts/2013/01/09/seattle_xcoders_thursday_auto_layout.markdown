My minimal experience with auto layout is unhappy. I need to learn it. So I’m looking forward to Kyle Sluder’s presentation <a href="http://seattlexcoders.org/2013/01/07/january-10---auto-layout-and-google-maps.html">January 10 on Auto Layout</a>.

Note that this meeting is not at the normal place: it’s at the Microsoft Accelerator on Westlake.

There will also be a Q&A with the Google Maps for iOS team. (A bunch of the work on that app was done locally.)
