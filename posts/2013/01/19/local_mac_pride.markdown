Congratulations to Aged & Distilled on releasing <a href="http://aged-and-distilled.com/napkin/">Napkin</a> and congratulations to Black Pixel on <a href="http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/">Kaleidoscope</a>!

Both apps are awesome. And both are made, at least in part, in Seattle. Local hero Chris Parrish is half of Aged & Distilled, and the Black Pixel machine of cool is on upper Queen Anne.

I love that Napkin and Kaleidoscope are both *Mac* apps.

I can’t talk about local Mac app makers without mentioning Omni. I wish like crazy I could make it to their <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/thedebut/">OmniFocus 2 event</a> in San Francisco on January 31. OmniFocus saves my bacon.

And there’s Flying Meat, home of the wonderful <a href="http://voodoopad.com/acorn/">Acorn</a> and <a href="http://voodoopad.com/voodoopad/">VoodooPad</a>, both of which I recommend highly.

We have a strong tradition of Mac app development in Seattle — and it’s stronger now than ever.

All you have to do to meet all these folks is attend <a href="http://seattlexcoders.org">Seattle Xcoders</a> meetings. Some folks just show up for the after-meeting get-together, which is usually at the Cyclops. So add that to your plans.
