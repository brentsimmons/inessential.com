>Instead of focusing on what your app does, focus on what your app is. This will help your personal brand show through, which will be more unique and more recognizable.

Somehow I’d never met Louie until a couple days ago at the <a href="http://renaissance.io">Renaissance conference</a> — which was a good conference, and I hope they repeat it next year. I learned things and made new friends.

Louie is one-third of <a href="http://www.pacifichelm.com">Pacific Helm</a>, which you should know about.
