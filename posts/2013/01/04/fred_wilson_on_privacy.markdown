A VC: <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/01/feature-friday-privacy.html">Feature Friday: Privacy</a>:

>The thing I want to talk about here is the emergence of privacy as the defining feature of the next breakaway app on the social internet. What does this mean for where we are and where we are going? Is open social out and closed private in?

My co-worker <a href="http://walkerfenton.blogspot.com/2013/01/privacy-its-not-just-for-breakfast.html">Walker Fenton says</a>, “Yes, privacy is ‘in,’ but you might not hear about it.”

That’s the tricky part.
