<a href="http://www.jakesavin.com/2013/01/11#a1368">Jake Savin speculates</a> that my code formatting style is a result of writing UserTalk in Frontier’s outline-based script editor.

I see his point — but the more likely reason is that the Frontier kernel code uses the brace-at-end-of-line style, and that was my first large C project.
