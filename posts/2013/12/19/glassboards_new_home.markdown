[Second Gear acquires Glassboard](http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/blog/glassboard-acquired-by-second-gear/). Second Gear is Justin Williams, [@justin](https://twitter.com/justin).

I’m so pleased. I don’t have any business interest in this sale — just the personal satisfaction of knowing that software I helped create is going to a great home.

I use Glassboard every day. It’s the main way Q Branch communicates. I use it with my family, with the local Xcoders group, and with other small projects.

This acquisition marks a personal moment: everything I brought to NewsGator, or created while there, has been passed off to another company. None of my apps remain. They’ve moved to [Black Pixel](http://netnewswireapp.com/), [Push.io](http://taplynx.com/), [Red Sweater](http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/), and now [Second Gear](http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/).
