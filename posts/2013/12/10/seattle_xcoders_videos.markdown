We’ve started recording videos. <a href="http://vimeo.com/seattlexcoders">Three of them are up on Vimeo</a>: The Invisible HIG by Chris Brummel, UIKit Dynamics by Izzy Fraimow, and Auto Layout: Thinking with Constraints by Kyle Sluder.

There’s a meeting [this Thursday](http://seattlexcoders.org/2013/12/10/laying-out-text-in-ios-and-os-x.html). Kyle on Text Kit. I have some experience with Text Kit already, and I’m looking forward to learning more. (After the meeting we’ll go to the [Cyclops](http://www.cyclopsseattle.com/), as normal.)
