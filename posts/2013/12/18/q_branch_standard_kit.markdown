We just posted [Q Branch Standard Kit](https://github.com/quartermaster/QSKit) — QSKit, for short — to GitHub.

It’s a bunch of categories and utilities that we find useful in multiple apps (both Mac and iOS). Nothing earth-shaking or high-tech — just solid stuff. With tests.

Consider it an early Christmas present from us to the community that’s given us so much.

(This is one of the perks of my return to indie life: I can release open source software again. I’m so glad.)
