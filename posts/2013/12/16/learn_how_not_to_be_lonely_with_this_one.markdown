The promise of Twitter is that it’s live people, but the reality is that it’s Live People Magazine.

Justin Bieber has 47,751,842 followers at this writing. A recent tweet — “Listening to music. #Journals #7days” — has 40,164 retweets and 28,504 favorites. Replies include “@justinbieber love u” and “@justinbieber i love youuuuu.”

Replies also include people begging to be followed back, which is the saddest thing I’ve seen all day. (Admittedly I haven’t been awake that long.)

You might say that’s not fair, but look at the numbers. This is what Twitter *is*. People Magazine has more substance.

If I go to the website I can see “What’s happening now, tailored for you.” And I see tweets from ESPN (don’t care), Variety (don’t care), Gizmodo (don’t care), and so on.

(I just clicked on a few trending topics, something I never do. I’m reminded why. I can’t bear to describe what I saw.)

Twitter’s job, it’s only job, is promotion. In return it gives people the illusions of information and human connection in 140-character-bites, which is the least — I mean it — the least it could do.

TechHive: [Promoted Accounts land in mobile Twitter timelines](http://www.techhive.com/article/2080801/promoted-accounts-land-in-mobile-twitter-timelines.html):

>Well, now you’ll see those accounts in your mobile timeline, where you didn’t before. Also, advertisers will be able to add a geotargeted call-to-action message to entice you into following them. This will affect the 76 percent of Twitter users who access the site from their smartphones…

>It’s worth noting that Twitter only makes money if users click on Promoted Accounts — the same applies to Sponsored Tweets — so making those ads as engaging as possible is the social network’s M.O.

Every frog likes the warmer water. It feels like that first summer and those carefree tadpole days.
