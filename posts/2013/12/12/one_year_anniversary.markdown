We formed Q Branch on 12/12/12. We wanted an easy-to-remember date.

I didn’t start working on Vesper until the beginning of February 2013 — I waited until I was finished with my then-current job. Though I initially conceived of Q Branch as a side project, it took me almost no time to change my mind and go full-time. (Then I had to give a reasonable amount of notice and wait.) That was one of the best decisions of my career.

A year ago I was a designer for an enterprise app I didn’t care about — or even like in the least tiny bit — and which you’ve never seen or heard of. That’s no way to live.

And now I work with my friends on [Vesper](http://vesperapp.co/). *That’s* the way to live.
