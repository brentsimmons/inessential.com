The [App Santa sale](http://appsanta.co/) is still going on. (I believe it ends the 28th.)

Maybe you got an iTunes gift card?

Vesper, Launch Center Pro, and Day One are just $2.99. 1Password is $9.99. Tweetbot and Clear+ are both $1.99. And there are plenty of other cool apps.

If you want any of these, [don’t forget to buy them](http://appsanta.co/) before they go back to their regular prices.
