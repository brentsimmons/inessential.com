There isn’t really any such thing as Google Reader API documentation.

But I do have a PDF document that Nick Bradbury wrote up when we were switching FeedDemon and NetNewsWire from NewsGator syncing to Google Reader.

It’s from 2009. Parts of it are surely out-of-date (authentication, for sure), and it was written with the expectation that the reader is familiar with NewsGator syncing.

Nevertheless, in the spirit of Marco’s <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/03/14/baby-steps-replacing-google-reader">baby steps toward replacing Google Reader</a>, I present it (with Nick’s permission) in case it’s useful to anyone:
