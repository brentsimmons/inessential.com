Here’s something website owners should realize:

You might look at your logs and find that Google Reader reports 100,000 subscribers. (For instance.)

And then you look and find that clients apps X, Y, and Z don’t seem to hit your feed all that often.

The easy conclusion is that Google Reader has thousands more users than X, Y, and Z. But that wouldn’t necessarily be correct.

#### Here’s Why

If X uses Google Reader for syncing, then X doesn’t read your feed directly. It gets it from Google Reader, and that person is reported to you under the Google Reader subscription count.

So it’s possible that half — or whatever — of those Google Reader subscribers are using X. (Or Y or Z.)

Or not. Or more than half.

You just have no way of knowing. But it’s a safe bet that more people are using client apps than your logs report.
