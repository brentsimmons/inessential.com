<a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/ios/">I recorded some videos</a> for Azure Mobile Services.

Mobile Services is a relatively new component of Azure — a high-level component. The idea is to make it easy to put together back-end services for your iOS app. It has a <a href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-mobile-services">Cocoa SDK on GitHub</a>. You write server-side code in JavaScript (not .NET) and store data in a SQL database. It does things like sending email and push notifications.

I got paid for doing the videos, of course — that’s how these things work. But I wouldn’t have done them if I didn’t think Mobile Services is cool and useful. It is.

(I’ve been filmed while on stage before — but this is the first time I’ve talked directly to the camera. Cameras are <em>cold</em>. It was weird! But fun. I’d do videos again.)
