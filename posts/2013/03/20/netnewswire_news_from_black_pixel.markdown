Black Pixel writes, in <a href="http://blackpixel.com/blog/2013/03/the-return-of-netnewswire.html">The Return of NetNewsWire</a>, that future versions will have syncing, despite the end of Google Reader.

Other points:

* They’ve been working on new versions, including modern designs and new features.

* Sync has been delayed because they were trying to get iCloud Core Data sync working, and it’s <a href="http://storify.com/Jury/the-trials-of-icloud">just too buggy</a>.
