My friend and former co-worker Nick Bradbury writes of <a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2013/03/the-end-of-feeddemon.html">The End of FeedDemon</a>:

>That was the nail in the coffin for me. I hate to say goodbye to FeedDemon after a decade of working on it, but it’s time to say goodbye. When Google Reader shuts down on July 1, FeedDemon will also disappear.

Before Nick and I were co-workers, we were both indie developers working on RSS readers. (Check out this <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/2476892">Economist article from 2004</a> that mentions us both.) We weren’t competitors, since FeedDemon ran on Windows and NetNewsWire ran on Macs.

NetNewsWire shipped first — but FeedDemon shipped features faster than I did, and I shamelessly stole some good bits. Which Nick didn’t mind. (He encouraged me, even.) We became friends, and later became co-workers.

It makes me sad to read of the end of FeedDemon. It mattered to me. But, more than that, I’m sad for my friend.
