Here’s the <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html">announcement</a> on the official Google Reader blog.

I called it in my post last month: <a href="http://inessential.com/2013/02/11/rss_sync_apocalypse_preview">RSS Sync Apocalypse Preview</a>.

And I’ve written about Google Reader in <a href="http://inessential.com/2011/10/24/google_reader_and_mac_ios_rss_readers_th">Google Reader and Mac/iOS RSS readers that sync</a> in late 2011.

I think this is a good thing for RSS and RSS readers in general — but it’s sure going to hurt RSS reader customers unless people come up with a sync solution quickly.

My preference: somebody would write a sync service — and charge a monthly subscription — and allow any RSS reader to use it.

Other things I’ve written about RSS syncing:

* <a href="http://inessential.com/2010/02/08/idea_for_alternative_rss_syncing_system">Idea for alternative RSS syncing system</a>
* <a href="http://inessential.com/2011/10/25/why_just_store_the_app_data_on_dropbo">Why “Just Store the App Data on Dropbox” won’t work for RSS readers</a>
* <a href="http://inessential.com/2011/11/17/how_about_imap_for_rss_syncing_">How about IMAP for RSS syncing?</a>
* <a href="http://inessential.com/2010/02/09/on_the_benefits_of_thin-server_rss_synci">On the benefits of thin-server RSS syncing</a>

Part of my reason for talking about this so often over the years was to encourage people to build a new sync system. Now you don’t need my encouragement. :) But if I can advise in any way, get in touch with me.
