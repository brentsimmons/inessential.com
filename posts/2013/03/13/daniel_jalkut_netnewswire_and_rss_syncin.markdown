<a href="http://bitsplitting.org/2013/03/13/netnewswire-cloud/">NetNewsWire Cloud</a>:

>By implementing a suitable syncing API for RSS, <em>and implementing a reasonably useful web interface</em>, Black Pixel could establish NetNewsWire Cloud as the de facto replacement for Google Reader. Charging a reasonable fee for this service would likely inoculate it from the risk of sudden termination, and it would doubly serve to provide the very service that NetNewsWire needs to thrive on the desktop and on iOS.
