While the demise of Google Reader got all the attention, there are some other things going away in <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html">A second spring of cleaning</a>. It’s worth reading.

One of the interesting ones: the CalDAV API will be removed for all but whitelisted developers. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV">CalDAV</a> builds on WebDAV and is an open standard. Instead you’d have to use the <a href="https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/">Google Calendar API</a>.

I wouldn’t have noticed this except that I was out with two calendar developers last night: John Chaffee of <a href="http://www.busymac.com/busycal/">BusyCal</a> and Michael Simmons of <a href="http://flexibits.com">Flexibits</a>. I suspect they’ve got some coding to do.

Google certainly has the right to shut things down — and I think they’re right to do so, also. The company’s been all over the place and should continue to work on focus.

But I don’t like when they turn off existing support for an open standard like CalDAV in favor of a Google-only API. Sure, they can — it’s within their rights, obviously. But I don’t like it.
