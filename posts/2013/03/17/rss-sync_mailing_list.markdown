I created a new mailing list for people who want to <a href="http://lists.ranchero.com/listinfo.cgi/rss-sync-ranchero.com">talk about the technical side of RSS syncing</a>.

Ideally there would be a single standard for RSS syncing, and clients could choose among systems. But I don’t insist on that — at least not yet. I think it’s ambitious enough just to get some working sync systems up and running.
