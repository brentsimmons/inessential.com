<a href="https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/episode/mark-boszko-video-producer">In this episode</a> I *finally* get around to talking to Mark Boszko, the show’s intrepid producer and The Omni Group’s Video Producer.

I’ve known Mark for more than ten years — we met at a SXSW conference many years ago, long before either of us came to Omni. Mark didn’t even live in Seattle in those days. Now he does, and now we have the pleasure of working together on a podcast.

PS If you like movies, definitely check out the podcast Mark hosts: <a href="http://opticalpodcast.com">The Optical</a>.
