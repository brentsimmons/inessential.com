Check out <a href="https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/episode/ken-case-on-omnis-2018-roadmap">episode #7</a> (I wish we had called it 007) where Ken Case talks about all the good stuff coming up in 2018.

There will be new releases of OmniOutliner, OmniPlan, and OmniGraffle — plus a  whole bunch of great stuff for OmniFocus 3.0 for Mac and iOS, including tags, JavaScript scripting, and OmniFocus for the web.

You can subscribe to the podcast or just listen to this episode — there’s a player on the page. Or you can read the transcript.

I’ve been wondering if other companies in our world are doing similar podcasts.

There is the [Supertop Podcast](http://blog.supertop.co/post/154137875967/supertop-podcast) from our friends who make [Castro](http://supertop.co/castro/). And there are much larger companies (such as Microsoft) who create videos and podcasts.

It may be that Omni’s size is somewhat unique in the Mac and iOS world: it’s big enough that we won’t run out of people to interview and topics to talk about, which could be tricky for a 5- or 10-person company. And it’s small enough to still be intimate — my goal is to eventually interview every single person who works here. (Though, of course, people can decline: it’s not required!)

Anyway: there was a time before companies had blogs, and now they have blogs. I wonder if more and more companies will find value in having a podcast too.

(And a <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/slack/">Slack group</a>. And a [Micro.blog account](https://micro.blog/omni).)
