I have a vision for 1.0, and then, as time goes on, I have to cut it back beyond where it hurts. I have to keep punting. I hate this part of shipping software.

But I also love it because it reminds me that I have the stomach for it. Shipping software is an emotional skill.

After shipping — no matter what — there will be people who absolutely cannot believe that feature X wasn’t included. In fact, it’s the one thing they totally need.

And they’re right. Not wrong. And I would have loved to have included feature X, loved I not quality (the app maker’s honor) more.

I wondered if Evergreen as open source instead of as a for-pay app would affect what and how much I punt. I hope the answer is: not at all; the decisions would have been the same.

I think that’s right because I’m trying to make as good an app as I can, which would be true regardless.

But it *is* nice not to have to consider money as I make decisions. I do think about how I want it to have as many users as possible, and I want people to love the app. And I have to think about the economy of my time. But I don’t have to consider money.

Another difference between open source and commercial is that I can be utterly transparent about what’s been punted. Check out Evergreen’s <a href="https://github.com/brentsimmons/Evergreen/milestone/4">2.0 milestone</a>. It will keep growing. Every single one of those things was originally supposed to go in <a href="https://github.com/brentsimmons/Evergreen/milestone/1">1.0</a>.

Some things I keep reminding myself as I make progress toward 1.0…

This isn’t the last release, it’s the *first*. There will be many more. (I hope to work on this app for 20 years. It’s been only three years so far.)

Any feature I ship, I probably have to support forever. So it’s wise to be cautious.

Quality — design, stability, performance, lack of bugs — is way more important than any collection of features.

And, perhaps most importantly: shipping 1.0 means learning about your users, how they use your app, and what they need — and those lessons *will change* future plans, as they should. It’s best to learn those lessons early, before doing too much.
