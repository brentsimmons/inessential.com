<a href="https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/episode/liz-marley-omnigraffle-engineer">This episode features Liz Marley</a>, OmniGraffle engineer, formerly a tester and PM.

She talks about switching from testing to writing code â€” and about how she came to do technical talks using Swift playgrounds. Playgrounds with ducks, that is, because every good playground has ducks.
