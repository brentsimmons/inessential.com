I don’t remember the opening day of the App Store as well as I remember the July 4th before as I was frantically finishing up NetNewsWire 1.0 for iPhone — so I could get it submitted in time.

As people were coming to my house for a big family barbecue. As I was stuck inside on a nice day.

As I did get it finished, and then we had a great barbecue, and then on App Store day one it was all worth it. :)
