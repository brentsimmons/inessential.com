Script Debugger has long been the secret weapon of people who write AppleScript scripts — and [now it’s at version 7](http://latenightsw.com/). Better than ever!

Plus really [cool](https://twitter.com/brentsimmons/status/969696645951537152) [new](https://twitter.com/brentsimmons/status/969697365950062592) icons!

[Evergreen](https://ranchero.com/evergreen/) is AppleScript-able. So are [Omni’s Mac apps](https://omnigroup.com/). So is [Acorn](https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/). And [MarsEdit](https://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/). And so many others.

(Bonus tip: [FastScripts](https://red-sweater.com/fastscripts/) is a great utility for running AppleScript scripts. I use it all day every day.)
