Now that I’ve switched over to marketing, people — co-workers, even! — keep asking me what I actually *do* all day.

Fair question. Since I’ll probably get asked the same thing in San Jose next week, I figured I’d write it up.

#### The team

Our team could be a small software company on its own — we have engineers, testers, designers, and a [person who makes movies](https://twitter.com/bobtiki). Everything I do is part of working with that team.

If you think I’m being paid to be a blogger and podcaster, you’re not too far off the mark, but that description misses some things.

I’ve traded in Xcode for [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) and [Marked](http://marked2app.com/), since most of what I do is writing. I write for the [blog](https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/) and for the [podcast](https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/), of course, and also lately I’ve written:

* Inside OmniFocus blog posts
* App Store editorial pitch
* Sponsorship blurbs for podcasts
* App Store description for OmniFocus 3 for iOS
* Product pages and related pages for OmniFocus 3 for iOS and OmniFocus 2 for Mac
* Some first-run text in OmniFocus 3
* Press release
* Other release-related email
* Omni microblog (OmniDogs!)
* Newsletter
* Various tweets

Note: again, though, it’s a team effort. Some things go through extensive feedback and editing before being finished.

And some things — like the product pages — will evolve a bunch during design and production. As it takes shape we can see where the writing needs to change.

And some things I write — especially anything that ends up in an app — will probably get revised by other people before it ships.

I do some things besides writing. I edit customer stories for Inside OmniFocus. I work with people who write to Omni’s marketing email address.

And even the writing isn’t just writing — I help figure out *what* to write, and when, and how to talk about things.

So there you have it. I’m part of a team, and my particular role is the _words_. And there are a lot of words.
