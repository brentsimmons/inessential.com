Om Malik [on blogging](https://om.co/2018/06/15/you-know-that-thing-called-blogging/):

>They are incomplete and by nature more mysterious, more episodic, and thus more interesting. Blogs are meant not to leave you with everything. The whole idea is to think to deliberate, and to come back again and again, to finish what was started a long time ago. But there is no end, just a pause, for a voice to start, talking again.

I love that.

I never became the Hemingway or Fitzgerald type of writer that I wanted to be when I was young. No short stories, no novel, no cover of Life magazine.

But I *have* written a blog for almost 19 years — and that’s something. It‘s still a new medium, *and* it’s new to have blogs hitting ([and even passing](http://scripting.com/)) the 20-years-mark.

Here’s a provisional thought (all thoughts on a blog are provisional) — to read a good blog is to watch a writer get a little bit better, day after day, at writing the truth.
