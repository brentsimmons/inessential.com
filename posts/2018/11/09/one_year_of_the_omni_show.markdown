It just popped in my head to check today — and, sure enough, I’ve been doing [The Omni Show](https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/) podcast for just over a year now.

There are a bunch of reasons why I like doing it. The main reason is that it’s fun to show the personalities of the people who work at Omni — and the personality of the company — to the outside world.

It’s also fun as a way for co-workers to get to know each other a little better. We’re showing our personality to *ourselves*.

I also like it as documentation. This is a special time — our industry is still so young — and so I like it in the same way I liked doing [The Record](http://therecord.co/) with [Chris Parrish](https://twitter.com/twenty3/). This history will all be lost unless we record it.

And recording this history means not just talking to the usual suspects, the same people you hear every week. It means talking to people who’ve never been on podcasts before, but who all have stories to tell. This is a personal challenge — it takes extra work to prepare for someone different every episode — but it’s so satisfying. I love it.

PS For the curious: last April I wrote, on The Omni Blog, [How We Do the Omni Show](https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/how-we-do-the-omni-show).
