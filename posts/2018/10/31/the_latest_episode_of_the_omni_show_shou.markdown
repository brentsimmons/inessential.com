The latest episode of The Omni Show should be of interest to developers — it’s all about [building OmniFocus for the Web](https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/episode/how-we-built-omnifocus-for-the-web).

Remember that OmniFocus is a Mac and iOS app written in Objective-C and Swift. The answer for how Omni made it work on the web is the most Omni thing ever. :)
