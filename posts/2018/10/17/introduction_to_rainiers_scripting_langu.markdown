I just posted a [tech note for Rainier’s scripting language, Ballard](https://github.com/brentsimmons/Rainier/blob/master/Technotes/IntroductionToBallard.markdown).

Feedback is welcome, of course. Best place is on the Slack group. (You can find my email address near the bottom of [this page](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) and then email me to ask for an invitation.)

(Note: other tech notes on the Rainier site are out of date, so I’d skip ’em for now.)
