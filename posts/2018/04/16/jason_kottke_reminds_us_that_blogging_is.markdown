Jason Kottke [reminds us that blogging is most certainly not dead](https://kottke.org/18/04/blogging-is-most-certainly-not-dead), and that there are great blogs out there.

My only objection is the use of the word “dead” to apply to things that aren’t alive. Even when you’re saying that something is not dead.

I’ve done it myself. It’s shorthand, yes, but it’s a broad binary take when something more nuanced and true would be warranted.
