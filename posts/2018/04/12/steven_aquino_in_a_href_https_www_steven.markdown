Steven Aquino, in <a href="https://www.stevensblog.co/blogs/giving-tweetbot-a-more-accessible-design">Giving Tweetbot a More Accessible Design</a>, writes that Twitter’s official client for iOS does a good job with accessibility:

>The UI design is much higher contrast — Twitter for iOS even acknowledges when you have the system’s Increase Contrast setting  enabled, as I do. And, crucially, the official client natively supports alt-text, which allows users to append image descriptions for the blind and low vision before tweeting.
