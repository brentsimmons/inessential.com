The [latest episode of The Omni Show](https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/episode/omnifocus-3-potpourri-with-dave-messent-tim-ekl-and-jim-correia) is a special episode — we talk about OmniFocus 3 and flexible inspectors, enhanced repeating tasks, batch editing, and the interleaved Forecast view.

Regular interview shows are our bread and butter, but these roundtables are fun to do too. (And I can’t wait for [The Omni Show Live](https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/the-omni-show-live) next door to WWDC!)
