A line in Frank Chimero’s article [Everything Easy Is Hard Again](https://frankchimero.com/writing/everything-easy-is-hard-again/), published a couple months ago, has stuck with me:

>That breaks my heart, because so much of my start on the web came from being able to see and easily make sense of any site I’d visit. I had view source, but each year that goes by, it becomes less and less helpful as a way to investigate other people’s work.

One of the ironies of this is that [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) makes it easier than ever to make readable, simple HTML. I especially like two things:

1. Quotes for attribute values are optional (when there are no spaces), and
2. There are semantic tags for things where before you had to guess at the author’s intention. We have `header`, `main`, `nav`, `article`, and similar now.

I realized that this blog — since it doesn’t use cookies or JavaScript, since the layout is as straightforward as can be — would make a good personal test case. How easy-to-read can I make the HTML?

So I adopted the semantic HTML5 tags, simplified a few things, and now the source is as easy to read as any HTML I’ve ever written.

Lesson learned: the discoverable and understandable web is still do-able — it’s there waiting to be discovered. It just needs some commitment from the people who make websites.
