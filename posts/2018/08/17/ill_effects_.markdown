Have I noticed any ill effects from being [done with Twitter](http://inessential.com/2018/08/08/the_public_square) over a week ago?

Well, I was on vacation for much of it (was in North Dakota; back now) and so maybe it’s not a fair test. But I don’t feel that frequent compulsion to *just keep checking what people are saying now*, which is nice.

(I’ve got a full bouquet of compulsions in full bloom — I feel like dropping any one of them is a victory. Or a small relief, at least.)

I keep thinking this thought: nothing that is said on Twitter is actually important to me. It could go away suddenly one morning and I’d be the same.

Twitter from the outside now looks like a massive world-wide frenzy for no reason. It’s the illusion of something valuable.
