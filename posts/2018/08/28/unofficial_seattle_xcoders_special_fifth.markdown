Unofficial Seattle Xcoders special fifth Thursday event is this week — it’s, well, on Thursday at 6:30 pm at the Waterwheel in Ballard.

(Note: not Cyclops! Waterwheel is our fifth Thursday place.)

It’s a fun time and everyone is welcome — designers, testers, support folks, documentarians, managers, fans of iOS and Mac apps.

Even marketers are welcome! Which means I’ll be there. :)

(To be fair to myself: I did [commit some code yesterday](https://github.com/brentsimmons/RSDatabase/commit/c3c9181356135e9999e6e2bd74656d21015e1e7c).)
