[On my latest The Omni Show](https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/episode/omnifocus-3-for-mac-new-features) — the podcast I do at work — we (me, Dave Messent, Ken Case) talk about upcoming features in OmniFocus 3 for Mac.

I consider myself amazingly fortunate to be able to do podcasting and blogging for a living. :)
