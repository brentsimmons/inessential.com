If you’d like to run it, go to the [NetNewsWire site](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) and download the latest build.

Things to know:

* A whole bunch of important features haven’t even been started yet
* There are features not finished yet
* There are bugs
* It’s not even beta. Not even alpha!
* It still has the Evergreen app icon

If you’re upgrading from Evergreen, you can either:

* Start fresh, or
* Rename the folder `~/Library/Application Support/Evergreen` to `~/Library/Application Support/NetNewsWire`, or
* If you already have a `NetNewsWire` folder there, copy the contents of the above-mentioned `Evergreen` folder into that `NetNewsWire` folder.

Note: I’ve started a Slack group, but I don’t have a public signup form for it yet. You can email me to ask for an invitation. Just let me know if I should use an email address other than the one you used to email me. (You can find my email address at the bottom of the [NetNewsWire site](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/).)

You don’t have to be on the Slack to help. You can always contact me by whatever means, and you can post to the [Issues tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/brentsimmons/NetNewsWire/issues).
