In [NetNewsWire 5](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/), you can add your [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) feed of people you follow, so you can read their posts in NetNewsWire.

Here’s how:

Figure out the URL. It’s something like this, where my username is replaced with your username: `https://micro.blog/feeds/brentsimmons.json`

In NetNewsWire, hit cmd-N. (Or click the + button in the toolbar.) Put that URL in the **URL** field in the sheet that appears. Give it a name if you want, and choose a folder if you want. Then click the **Add** button.

That’s it!

#### Posting to Micro.blog

If you have the Micro.blog app on your Mac, you can select an article in NetNewsWire, then pull down the share menu in the toolbar, and choose Micro.blog. 

It will send that article to the Micro.blog app, where you can edit and comment before posting.

The same thing works for [MarsEdit](https://red-sweater.com/marsedit/), so you can post to any blog.
