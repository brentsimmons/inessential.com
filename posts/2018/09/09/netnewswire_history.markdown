On the [NetNewsWire blog](https://nnw.ranchero.com/) I’ve been publishing bits of NetNewsWire history. It’s a look at the history of our industry through the eyes of one single 16-year-old app.

Though I have my own blogging software, for the NetNewsWire blog I decided to go with Micro.blog and my own domain (nnw.ranchero.com). It’s easier to use than my own software — especially when it comes to adding pictures, and I definitely want to use a lot of screenshots on this blog.

I set it up to automatically cross-post to [@NetNewsWire](https://twitter.com/netnewswire) on Twitter. I don’t love Twitter, obviously, but I feel it’s important, when you have a product, even a free one, to be accessible wherever the users are.
