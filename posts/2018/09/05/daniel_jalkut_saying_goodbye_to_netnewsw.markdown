Daniel Jalkut, [Saying Goodbye to NetNewsWire 3](https://bitsplitting.org/2018/09/05/saying-goodbye-to-netnewswire-3/):

>Since I’m not the only stalwart NetNewsWire 3 user, one of the things Brent was curious about was whether he could give that version “one last hurrah,” so to speak. Fix a few of the most glaring bugs, build against a modern SDK, and not only create an artifact for history to more accurately judge the app’s virtues, but to give long-standing users something to tide them over while development continues on NetNewsWire 5.
