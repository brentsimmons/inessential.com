My friend Geoffrey — the one with the big beard in the pictures in the linked-to page — is opening Fair Isle Brewing in Seattle, in Ballard (my neighborhood), next year. They’re doing farmhouse and wild beer.

[You can invest](https://www.nextseed.com/offerings/fair-isle-brewing/) as little as $100 if this interests you. More about farmhouse beer:

>Farmhouse beer is one of the most exciting and fastest growing segments in the beer industry. These special beers are fermented with a mixed culture that includes local, wild yeasts and bacteria; instead of the laboratory-isolated and tightly controlled commercial yeasts that are more typically used today. Farmhouse brewing techniques embrace the local environment. Like fine wines, Fair Isle’s beers are all about a specific place and a specific time.

I think it’s going to be a success — but that’s because I know Geoffrey. We’re talking about investing money here, so please make up your own mind!
