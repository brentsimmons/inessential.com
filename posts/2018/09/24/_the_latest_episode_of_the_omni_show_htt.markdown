[The latest episode of The Omni Show](https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/episode/omnifocus-3-for-mac-launch-day-new-design) is ostensibly about launch day — but mostly it’s a discussion of the new design in OmniFocus 3 for Mac. How it started, how it evolved, how it ended up.

It’s of obvious interest to OmniFocus users, but I think the discussion is also interesting to anybody who cares about app design.

(I think it’s one of the best episodes, by far.)
