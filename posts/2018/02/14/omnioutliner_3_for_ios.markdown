I’d done almost no iOS work since system 7 came out — but, once we were finished with [OmniOutliner 5 for Mac](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner/) (a release I’m super-proud of), it was time to go work on OmniOutliner 3 for iOS, and so they pulled me back in. :)

I was just one person on a much bigger team, of course. I helped indent some things and helped with filters. But there’s a whole bunch more besides — it’s a [big release](https://www.omnigroup.com/releasenotes/omnioutliner-ios/3.0.1).

And it’s the first OmniOutliner for iOS release with a lower-cost Essentials version ($9.99). And it’s a free trial.

And I’m super-proud of this release, too.
