In the [latest episode of The Omni Show](https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/episode/orion-protonentis-software-test-pilot) I talk to [Orion Protonentis](http://micro.blog/orionp), recovering actor and stage fighter, friend of Shakespeare, and Software Test Pilot.

The Scottish Play is mentioned, but only as “the Scottish play.” So we’re all good there — if you’re in a theater right now you can safely listen to this.
