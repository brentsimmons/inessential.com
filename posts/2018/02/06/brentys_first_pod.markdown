[RSParser](https://github.com/brentsimmons/RSParser) is now a CocoaPod! It’s my first.

I’m super-proud of myself for taking this the last few tiny steps of the way there — [Silver Fox](https://github.com/dcilia) did all the rest of the much-appreciated work.

This means that if you’re a CocoaPods user, you can now go forth and parse feeds.

Still to do: support Carthage and Swift Package Manager. And, after this repo, there are at least a half-dozen more to do.

But that’s okay — doing open source is what I signed up for, and learning and using the infrastructure is part of the gig.

PS I really like what happens in the Terminal when you successfully publish a pod. [Here’s a screenshot](http://images.inessential.com/PodShot.png).
