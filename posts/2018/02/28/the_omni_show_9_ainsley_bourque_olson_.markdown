[The latest episode of The Omni Show](https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/episode/ainsley-bourque-olson-omniplan-pm) features [Ainsley Bourque Olson](https://twitter.com/ainslaw) — who’s the *product* manager for [OmniPlan](https://www.omnigroup.com/omniplan), a *project* management app. It’s almost meta!

She’s also a knitter — we have a pretty strong group of knitters here — and a cat person.

Me too. In fact, I’m going to go find a place in the sun to curl up. :)
