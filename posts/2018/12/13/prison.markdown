I’ve said before that my fondest hope is that all these people go to prison, and that they come to regard Trump’s decision to run for president as the worst thing that ever happened to them.

It’s not schadenfreude — well, it’s not *just* that — it’s about *justice*.

It should be known by all, by everyone everywhere, that long-time criminals and fraudsters who feed hate, who betray their nation, will get what they deserve. They’ll get years behind bars and their liberties taken away. They’ll suffer the condemnation of history, and they’ll be known forever as dirt.

It should be known by their supporters — whose support is based on a mutual love of cruelty — that these kinds of people are buffoons who do *not* have their best interests at heart. The only interest they serve is their own corrupt self-interest. These kinds of people are not worth supporting.

Some are already in prison or heading there. I hope there are many more, and that this goes all the way to the top.
