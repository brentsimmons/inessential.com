The Xcoders group is for Seattle-area and Vancouver, BC folks who make apps — by writing code, testing, supporting, designing, and so on. They even let marketers like me in there. :)

I’ve been attending since 2005, but only recently started helping out more formally — I’ve been part of the effort to get our communications working a bit better.

We started a new blog at [https://xcoders.org/](https://xcoders.org/). It’s hosted by [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/), and we want to thank [Manton Reece](https://manton.org/) and [Jean MacDonald](http://macgenie.micro.blog/) for all their great work on the service.

We gave our blog its own domain name, xcoders.org — because that’s how you own your own content on the web. We also set it up to automatically cross-post to Twitter, to our existing [@xcoders](https://twitter.com/xcoders) account.

We’ve still got some work to do with design (and maybe a public calendar?), but we’ve got the standard links up there for downloads, videos, Slack signup, and our code of conduct.

If you use an RSS reader, you can follow it there instead of (or in addition to) Micro.blog or Twitter:

* JSON feed: [https://xcoders.org/feed.json](https://xcoders.org/feed.json)
* RSS: [https://xcoders.org/feed.xml](https://xcoders.org/feed.xml)

#### Next meeting

[As the site says](https://xcoders.org/2018/12/11/reminder-due-to.html), there are no talks at the next meeting — we’re going straight to the Cyclops in Belltown (which is just a few blocks from the standard meeting place). Be there!

Special note to people who don’t write code: you’re totally welcome! You’re *encouraged* to come, in fact, to this meeting and every meeting. It’s a great group of people and we’d like to meet you. :)
