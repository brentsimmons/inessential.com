I’m on the [latest Micro Monday podcast with Jean MacDonald](https://monday.micro.blog/2018/12/03/episode-brent-simmons.html)! It was so much fun to do.

We talk about podcasting and about the similar ideas behind [The Omni Show](https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/) and [Micro Monday](http://monday.micro.blog/). And [The Record](http://therecord.co/).

We also talk about [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) and about [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/).

Entirely coincidentally — Micro.blog has been [open to the public for a year](https://manton.org/2018/12/03/microblog-milestone-first.html) now. Congratulations to Manton and Jean on this big milestone!
