As reported by <a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/2003/11/06/source_lists_and_brushed_.html">Michael Tsai</a>, Apple has updated the Human Interface Guidelines on the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/XHIGWindows/chapter_16_section_3.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961/CHDHHBGJ">issue of metal windows</a>. It is now suggested that any window that “provides a source list to navigate information—for example, iTunes or the Finder” can be a metal window.</p>

<p>The first thing I think of is that NetNewsWire could then use a metal window, since it provides a source list.</p>

<p>The second thing I think is: <em>no way</em>.</p>

<p>The guidelines also say, “Don’t use the brushed metal look indiscriminately. Although it works well for some types of applications, some applications appear too heavy when using this look.”</p>

<p>I would rewrite that to say: “Don’t use the brushed metal look at all. Although some applications (such as iTunes and the Finder) use it, they all look too heavy when using this look.”</p>

<p>Intelligent people may disagree, of course. (And so I point to Unsanity’s <a href="http://www.unsanity.com/haxies/metallifizer/">Metallifizer</a>.)
