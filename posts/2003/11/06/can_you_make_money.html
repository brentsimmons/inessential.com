At the recent OS X conference, the question came up at the Innovators presentation whether it was possible to make money developing OS X applications.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s possible.</p>

<p>But, before you start, here’s some advice:</p>

<p><strong>1. Don’t expect investment from VCs or Apple or anybody else.</strong></p>

<p>You’ll need to fund development yourself. Folks developing for Windows or doing web applications may be able to find investment, but it’s been a long time since Mac development attracted investment.</p>

<p><strong>2. You need to have a really good idea for an app <em>that other people like</em>.</strong></p>

<p>It’s worthwhile to show a few people privately an early prototype. Choose people who won’t just say nice things because they like you. Your friends and family will be encouraging. You want honest opinions.</p>

<p>We originally had an app named MacNewsWire, the precursor to NetNewsWire, that didn’t catch fire. It had a fixed list of Mac news subscriptions. You couldn’t add or remove subscriptions. I thought it would be popular; it wasn’t.</p>

<p>Then I prototyped NetNewsWire and showed it to some people, and they liked it an awful lot. Had they not liked it, we would have done a different app.</p>

<p><strong>3. Communicate. Be open. Most of all, <em>listen</em>.</strong></p>

<p>If you don’t have a weblog, start one. Part of buying software from a small independent developer is knowing that you’re buying from people.</p>

<p>Put your bugs list on-line. Start a mailing list or two. You want to be open about your software and you want people to get to know you.</p>

<p>But the biggest part of this is listening to other people.</p>

<p><strong>4. Don’t imitate Apple.</strong></p>

<p>One of the things I see often is people name their apps iSomething; their apps use metal windows; their websites look like Apple’s website.</p>

<p>I think this is a mistake. I know these folks aren’t trying to fool people into thinking their apps are really made by Apple. However, the benefits of your own unique presence will outweigh any impression of a relationship to the iApps.</p>

<p><strong>5. Be realistic. Work matters.</strong></p>

<p>There’s no room for idealism of this sort: people <em>should</em> like your app, investors <em>should</em> provide funding.</p>

<p>What matters is what actually happens. When you concentrate on the shoulds you’re not working.</p>

<p>You need to work and keep working. There may be dinners and movies and even vacations, but then you come back to work.
