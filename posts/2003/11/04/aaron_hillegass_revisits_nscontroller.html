Aaron Hillegass had previously been quite critical of the new NSController layer in Panther; he <a href="http://cocoa.mamasam.com/COCOADEV/2003/11/1/76257.php">revisits NSController</a> in a new post to the cocoa-dev mailing list.</p>

<p>Aaron writes: “After many demonstrations of the power of NSController (‘Aaron, this 
app was 252,500 lines of code, but with NSController it is only 3!’), I must agree with them: life is better. They also agreed with me: there is much room for improvement.”
