I had lunch with Eric Albert and Buzz Andersen at the OS X conference. Eric helped me debug a mach port leak in NetNewsWire. It was in a method which counted the current number of threads in use.</p>

<p>In case you’re curious about how to count threads, here’s <a href="http://rescomp.stanford.edu/~ejalbert/archives/2003/10/29.html#001189">Eric’s post</a> on how to do it without leaking mach ports.
