I’ve been using Xcode for a couple weeks now. I’m learning it slowly, just learning new things as I notice them.</p>

<p>There are a few small but nice touches that I’ve come to rely on already. I haven’t seen these mentioned elsewhere, so I figured I’d mention them.</p>

<p>1. The Project toolbar button in source file windows.</p>

<p>When you’re editing a source file, you can get back to the Project window quickly by clicking the Project icon. I do this all the time.</p>

<p>2. The Show Editor toolbar button in project windows.</p>

<p>You can switch from three-paned-view to two-paned view easily. In other words, you can hide and show the source editor within the main project window.</p>

<p>3. The Console Window toolbar button in debugger windows.</p>

<p>By default, there’s a button for showing a Console drawer. But even on my 21" screen I need to make the console a separate window so I can stretch out the stack and source panes.</p>

<p>So if you do a customize toolbar on the debugger window you’ll find a Console Window button.
