The Rogue Amoeba folks write in <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/archives/000042.php">Macworld, “Shareware,” And The Future</a> about how it can be difficult to get your software reviewed in Macworld unless you’re a large software company.</p>

<p>NetNewsWire has been reviewed in Macworld, but that doesn’t take away from the good points made in this article. (And the article also points out that Macworld has made progress in this area with its new capsule reviews.)</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> Removed the capital W from Macworld, per <a href="http://www.backupbrain.com/2003_11_16_archive.html#a003647">Dori</a>, who has a good reply to all this.
