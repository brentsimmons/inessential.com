Aaron Swartz suggests <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001076">supporting Ralph Nader</a> as a Democratic nominee: “True, there are some hard feelings about his effect on the previous election, but I think voters will put that aside if he’s compelling enough.”</p>

<p>Aaron I think seriously underestimates the amount of anger still pointed at Nader. Darth Nader.
