One of the drawbacks to rolling your own weblog software is that any time you want to add a feature you have to do it yourself.</p>

<p>For instance, I’ve wished a few times that I could use Jay Allen’s <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/">MT-Blacklist</a> plugin. It would make it easier to fight comment spam.</p>

<p>(I have very good reasons for sticking with my own weblog software. I’m not going to change; please don’t suggest it.)</p>

<p>However, my software has a feature that would be cool to see in other weblog software, so I wanted to mention it: there’s an RSS feed that shows the last n comments, no matter which post they’re in reply to.</p>

<p>This means that no comment spam appears, even in very old posts, that I don’t see. I still have to go to the trouble of deleting it—but it’s much better than not knowing about it.</p>

<p>It may be that some other weblog software packages already have this feature. If so—cool. If yours doesn’t have this feature, you might want to consider it. I totally rely on it myself (and not just for fighting comment spam).</p>

<p>You might say—well, my weblog software does email notifications of comments, so an RSS feed of recent comments isn’t needed.</p>

<p>And I’d reply—well, my software has email notifications too. I found that I hardly ever looked at them. In amongst all the other email noise, comments notifications don’t work that well.</p>

<p>But an RSS feed for recent comments works wonderfully.
