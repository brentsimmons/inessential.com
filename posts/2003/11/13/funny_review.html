I don’t link to every review of NetNewsWire—but <a href="http://www.mymac.com/seibold/nnw_11.13.03.shtml">Chris Seibold’s review</a> is funny.</p>

<p><blockquote>Everyone knows what a RSS feed is, well maybe not everyone. If you don&#039;t know what an RSS feed is send me your home address and I&#039;ll personally come kick you to death for being so out of touch. I&#039;m joking, my knees feel like gravel in a Ziplock bag, I couldn&#039;t kick an ant to death.</blockquote>
