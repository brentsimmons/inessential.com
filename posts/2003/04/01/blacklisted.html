If you sent me email and didn&#8217;t get a response, it may be due to your service provider&#8217;s use of blacklists.</p>

<p>It happens to me now and again where someone send me email, and I reply, and I get a returned-to-sender email with something like this: <code>reason: 550 Your host is locally blacklisted, contact postmaster@example.com</code></p>

<p>The thing is, I use sendmail on my desktop machine. I have it set so it works only from my desktop machine. (And there is of course other security on my LAN.) </p>

<p>I guess this means that somewhere there&#8217;s a blacklist that includes localhost 127.0.0.1.</p>

<p>Nuts! I think these blacklists totally suck.
