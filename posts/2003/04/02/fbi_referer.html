On the referers page for ranchero.com I noticed a strange referer coming from homeland.fbi.gov. My DNS server doesn&#8217;t seem to know what homeland.fbi.gov is.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/strangereferer.jpg">screen shot</a> of (part of) my referers page.</p>

<p>The full URL is <a href="http://homeland.fbi.gov/Watchlists/suspect/view.jsp?record=235270">http://homeland.fbi.gov/Watchlists/suspect/view.jsp?record=235270</a>.</p>

<p>You might imagine that I&#8217;m very curious as to what&#8217;s on that page and why it links to ranchero.com.</p>

<p><em>Update 3 April 9:30 AM PST:</em> Yes, it&#8217;s probably a prank. See the comments for more info.
