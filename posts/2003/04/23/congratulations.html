Congratulations to the Movable Type folks! It all sounds like <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/press/six_apart_ltd_announces_new_weblogg.shtml">great news</a>.</p>

<p>I should note that doing hosting is difficult. It has the potential to be a Vietnam for any company whose main thing is software development. </p>

<p>That&#8217;s not to meant to be discouraging&#8212;I&#8217;m just saying that it&#8217;s important not to underestimate the amount of person-hours it can take to keep it going. Even with great software (which they definitely have) on a solid platform, weird, difficult surprises are inevitable.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s do-able. And I think it&#8217;s the right move for them, and I&#8217;m glad they&#8217;re doing it.</p>

<p>(By the way&#8212;I happen to be working on NetNewsWire&#8217;s Movable Type editing support this week, adding new features. If things go well, a public beta will be available later next week. I&#8217;m also adding not-on-home-page support for Radio UserLand editing.)
