NetNewsWire and Spring took <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/developer/2003/04/24/innovators.html">first and second place</a> in O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s Mac OS X Innovators contest. So cool!</p>

<p>Thanks to O&#8217;Reilly for the recognition&#8212;it&#8217;s <em>much</em> appreciated. And it was great to win along with Robb Beal.</p>

<p>But the main thanks as always go to the people who use NetNewsWire. All your bug reports, feature requests, and support are what make the difference between a so-so app and something better.</p>

<p>The next step is just to continue&#8212;fix bugs, add new features. Lots of exciting things are to come.
