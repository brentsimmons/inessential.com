Here&#8217;s what makes me a freak of nature: I have all four of my wisdom teeth. They all grew in fine, and the dentist doesn&#8217;t want to remove them.</p>

<p>I got a small filling in one of them today, but no big deal. They stay.</p>

<p>I have 0x20 teeth. The geek in me likes the round number.
