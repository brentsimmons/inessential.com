So, here&#8217;s where we are with NetNewsWire 1.0.2:</p>

<p>1. Lots of little bugs have been fixed.</p>

<p>2. The news reader performs better, especially for people who often have lots of unread headlines. Some memory leaks have been fixed.</p>

<p>3. The weblog editor hasn&#8217;t been touched much yet.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m working on #3&#8212;fixing bugs in the weblog editor and adding support for Radio UserLand and Movable Type options. Then I&#8217;ll release a beta.</p>

<p>NetNewsWire 1.0.2 will include only a few new features. Bug fixes and performance fixes are the main thing.</p>

<p>Despite all the great feature requests I get every day, I think this is the right thing to do.</p>

<p>People say that it&#8217;s features that bring in the money. And I believe that. New features are exciting and fun, because it&#8217;s new things you can do.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;m concentrating on bugs for now because:</p>

<p>1. Even if new features means more sales, the first responsibility is to the people who already bought the software.</p>

<p>2. New features may bring in more sales in the short run, but not fixing bugs will kill your product in the long run.
