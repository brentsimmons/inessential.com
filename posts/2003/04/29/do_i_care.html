So. <a href="http://www.apple.com/music/store/">Apple&#8217;s music store</a>.</p>

<p>Me, I like to buy CDs and play them on my stereo. I even like to listen to regular old radio. Does that make me weird?</p>

<p>Same with movies and stuff. I don&#8217;t want to watch movies on my computer. If it&#8217;s movie time, it&#8217;s time to get away from computers.</p>

<p>Am I a stick in the mud? Am I Amish?</p>

<p>I downloaded the new iTunes to check out the new store. No Sex Pistols. Call me skeptical.</p>

<p>(Update: no Specials either.)
