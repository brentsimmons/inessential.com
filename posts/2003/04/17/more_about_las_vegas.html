This past weekend was my first trip to Las Vegas. I didn&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d like it or not.</p>

<p>It would be so easy to have that puritanical teenager ideology and just say&#8212;ugh, bleh, it&#8217;s all fake.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;m a grown-up, so instead I could just try to enjoy it and see if I liked it. And I did.</p>

<p>We stayed at the Paris Hotel, which has scale replicas of the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe. The casino itself looks like the streets of Paris&#8212;but with games! Even the ceiling is painted blue with puffy clouds, like you&#8217;re walking around Paris in the late afternoon.</p>

<p>Sure, it&#8217;s not Paris. It&#8217;s funny, and fake&#8212;but gloriously fake.</p>

<p>But get this: Las Vegas is mostly about money. I didn&#8217;t know that money could be fun. In Las Vegas, money does tricks. It&#8217;s a fluid.</p>

<p>The night before we left I dreamt I was on the casino floor. Everything was the same as it really is&#8212;except that all the money glowed a fluorescent turquoise. It was beautiful.
