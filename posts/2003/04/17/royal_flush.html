<a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/">Sheila</a> and I spent last weekend in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d never gambled before, except for like $1.25 in Atlantic City once.</p>

<p>We were there in Las Vegas for a wedding&#8212;my sister got married (in the Bellagio!) to her high school sweetheart.</p>

<p>In amongst all the wedding stuff I found time to play video poker. I didn&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d enjoy gambling, but I did. Especially video poker. I could hardly sit down without walking away a few minutes later at least $20 up.</p>

<p>One night I got a royal flush. 10-J-Q-K-A, all diamonds. I walked away $70 up from that machine.</p>

<p>When you get a royal flush you <em>have</em> to cash out and just enjoy it for a while. It&#8217;s not like you can hope to do better.</p>

<p>In Las Vegas there are games even at the airport. So while we were waiting for our flight I had a few quarters in my pocket and I played them. Won $29.25. Just a last bit of luck before coming home.</p>

<p>But nobody was as lucky as my Mom. She didn&#8217;t play any games until we were leaving. So there we were at the airport. She puts a coin in a slot, pushes the button, and wins $30. She cashes out. Just one spin.
