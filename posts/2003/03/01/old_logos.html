In 1997 we were working on some logos for Ranchero Software. (It was right around this time I started working for UserLand, and so Ranchero Software went into hibernation.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been going through closets and old hard drives and things, so there&#8217;s bound to be a bunch of things like this over the next several days.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> Here&#8217;s the logo we eventually chose, which we used for several (hibernatory) years:</p>
