What&#8217;s the best optical mouse? (For Mac OS X, of course.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using the standard Apple optical mouse&#8212;and it&#8217;s great&#8212;except I also want a two-button mouse (at least two buttons) and a scroll wheel.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t care if the mouse itself is wireless. The cord doesn&#8217;t get in my way. It&#8217;s just important that it be optical&#8212;I can&#8217;t go back to mechanical mice.</p>

<p>What do you recommend?
