I just added focus rings to the current alpha (not yet public) of NetNewsWire. It&#8217;s weird that focus rings aren&#8217;t automatic with Cocoa, you need to do some extra work.</p>

<p>This came about from using <a href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a>, which I instantly fell in love with. It has focus rings around its table views.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;m still on the fence about it for NetNewsWire. Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/nnwfocusring.jpg">screen shot</a>.
