<p>We&#8217;re trying something new&#8212;new for us&#8212;we&#8217;re bundling NetNewsWire and UserCreations <a href="http://www.usercreations.com/spring/">Spring</a>. You can <a href="https://order.kagi.com/cgi-bin/store.cgi?storeID=2DQ">buy them together</a> for just $39.95.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s called the Breakaway Bundle. Why the name? I think we liked the sound. But it does make me think of a running back breaking away from his tacklers to run open field all the way to the end zone.</p>

<p>(Note to people who don&#8217;t follow American football: never mind the above image. Just think good thoughts.)</p>

<p>And the name has&#8212;at least for me&#8212;an undertone of something about the future, breaking away into the future with the next generation of Internet apps.
