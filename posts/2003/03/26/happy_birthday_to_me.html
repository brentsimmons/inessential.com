Happy Birthday to Me!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also <a href="http://barista.editthispage.com/">Josh Lucas&#8217; birthday</a>, though he has some personal bad news, sadly. My condolences go to Josh and his family.</p>

<p>I was born 0x023 years ago in Chicago. I left Chicago while I was still a baby, and I hadn&#8217;t been back until, coincidentally, this past weekend. I was at a bachelor party for my sister&#8217;s husband-to-be. It was totally fun.
