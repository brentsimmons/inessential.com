Last night I moved this site and ranchero.com to a new host, <a href="http://cornerhost.com/">Cornerhost</a>. This should mean that there are fewer&#8212;hopefully no&#8212;outages due to the database server getting stuck.</p>

<p>My previous host was great, except that running MySQL wasn&#8217;t their thing. (I think they may have been doing it only for me.) Cornerhost, on the other hand, specializes in running MySQL.</p>

<p>I moved to Cornerhost partly on <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/04/12/weblogfriendly_hosting.html">Mark Pilgrim&#8217;s recommendation</a>.</p>

<p>There may be some glitches with the website as a result of the move. If you notice anything messed up, please let me know.</p>

<p>(Known bug: the search engine isn&#8217;t back up yet.)
