The other day I asked <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=2427">what&#8217;s the best optical mouse</a>, and I got a bunch of comments.</p>

<p>So... what did I end up with?</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how the decision process went.</p>

<p>1. The feedback I got suggested there are three great mouse makers: Kensington, Microsoft, and Logitech.</p>

<p>2. My instinct is as always to support the little guy, so Microsoft was provisionally eliminated as a choice.</p>

<p>3. Then the feedback I got, and the research I did, suggested that Kensington has better Mac OS X software and support than Logitech. So I chose Kensington.</p>

<p>4. Then&#8212;how to choose a specific mouse? I wanted one in the $20 - $50 range that had at least two buttons and a scroll wheel. It had to be optical, of course (that was the whole point). Trackpads not allowed. And, of course, it had to not be completely ugly. (Hyper-concern with aesthetics is the mark of a good Mac user.)</p>

<p>This left just a few mice to choose from. I  chose the <a href="http://www.kensington.com/html/1212.html">Kensington Optical Elite</a>.</p>

<p>There were some runners-up&#8212;the <a href="http://www.kensington.com/html/1211.html">PocketMouse Pro</a>, for instance.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;ve been totally happy with the Optical Elite.
