<a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php">NetNewsWire 1.0.1fc1</a> fixes a weblog editor bug with saving drafts and includes a couple other minor changes.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire.php">change notes</a> for the whole scoop.</p>

<p>This is a final candidate release. We&#8217;re looking for deal-stopper bugs, bugs bad enough to prevent this from being released as 1.0.1.</p>

<p>Once 1.0.1 is released, we&#8217;ll go back to fixing bugs&#8212;and also adding new features, such as supporting more Movable Type options, allowing Radio users to specify that a post shouldn&#8217;t go on a home page, and so on.
