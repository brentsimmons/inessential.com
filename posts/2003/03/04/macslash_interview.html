<a href="http://www.macslash.org/Interview/03/03/04/1535234.shtml">MacSlash interviews me</a>. Cool. I like doing interviews.</p>

<p>One of the things I like about MacSlash and similar sites is how questions are submitted by readers of the site. You end up with some pretty surprising questions sometimes.
