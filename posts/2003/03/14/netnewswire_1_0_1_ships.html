Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/whatsnew/netnewswire101.php">What&#8217;s New in NetNewsWire 1.0.1</a> page. The biggest changes since 1.0 are crashing bug fixes.</p>

<p>But there are some other nice things too&#8212;the news reader, for instance, is more forgiving of feeds with errors, so parsing failures will happen less often.</p>

<p>Today I&#8217;m starting work on 1.0.2, which will include more bug fixes but also some new features. Based on the feedback I&#8217;ve been getting, it sounds like what&#8217;s most wanted are new features for the weblog editor&#8212;specifically, support for more Radio and Movable Type options.
