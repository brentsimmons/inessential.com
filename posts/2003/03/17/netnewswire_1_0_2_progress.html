In case you&#8217;re curious on how NetNewsWire 1.0.2 development is going...</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a four-step process:</p>

<p>1. Move low-level, relatively bug-free code into separate frameworks. The RSS parser, for instance, goes into a framework. (The main reason is that it makes code maintenance and testing easier, and it makes it so I can re-use this code easily in other software.)</p>

<p>2. Fix a bunch of small quick-hit bugs. Things like bugs with date display and keyboard shortcuts. A particular crashing bug in the weblog editor. That kind of thing.</p>

<p>3. Fix&#8212;or at least dramatically improve&#8212;performance and memory issues when one has lots of subscriptions and lots of unread headlines.</p>

<p>4. Add a few new features&#8212;mostly weblog editing features such as supporting more Radio and Movable Type options. (Some other things too.)</p>

<p>I gave myself a week to do step 1&#8212;but it&#8217;s already finished. I did it over the weekend. It was totally fun, by the way. If you&#8217;re a Cocoa developer, but you&#8217;ve shied away from building frameworks, you should know that it&#8217;s a piece of cake.</p>

<p>So now I&#8217;m in the middle of step 2, doing a bunch of quick-hit bug fixes. This is one of my favorite things to do, because it&#8217;s all about polish, getting the details right. With some good hours of brain-time you can knock off bugs by the anthill.</p>

<p>Later this week I&#8217;ll move on to performance and memory issues, then on to adding new features probably next week. Then I&#8217;ll release the first beta of 1.0.2.
