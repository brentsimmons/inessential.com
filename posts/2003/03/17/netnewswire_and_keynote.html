An <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0116463/2003/03/17.html">interesting feature request</a> for NetNewsWire appeared on Tom Bridge&#8217;s weblog today&#8212;creating Keynote presentations from RSS feeds.</p>

<p>Tom Bridge writes: &#8220;Imagine for just a moment with me. You wake up, and on the way to the shower flip open your powerbook, fire up NetNewsWire and go get clean. When you&#039;ve come back, NNW has created a Keynote presentation for you.&#8221; </p>

<p>It&#8217;s a good idea!</p>

<p>But... I have a few things to do first&#8212;fixing some bugs, adding new features to the weblog editor&#8212;before I could work on this. It will be a few weeks before I can do much with this idea.
