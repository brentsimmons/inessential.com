Now and again, when I have time, I like to write little funny stories. I don&#8217;t actually have time to write one right now, but I figured I&#8217;d point to a few of them, in case you&#8217;re relatively new to my weblog and may have missed them.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s one, probably the most popular, on doing <a href="http://inessential.com/2002/01/03.php">bong hits with Bill Gates</a>.</p>

<p>My personal favorite is on how <a href="http://inessential.com/2001/06/07.html">it&#8217;s so hard to teach squirrels to play baseball</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my <a href="http://inessential.com/2002/03/04.php">BBEdit song</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s one on the inherent evil of <a href="http://inessential.com/2002/01/17.php">that Three Dog Night song</a> Joy to the World.</p>

<p>Then there&#8217;s my list of <a href="http://inessential.com/2001/12/28.php">top ten really mean put-downs</a>.</p>

<p>Though it&#8217;s not terrifically funny, I like it as a rant: how I <a href="http://inessential.com/2001/05/18.php">don&#8217;t want wearable computers</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a post on how I like to <a href="http://inessential.com/2001/02/15.php">say inappropriate things</a>. I compare a part of my anatomy to a roll of duct tape.</p>

<p>Another personal favorite is <a href="http://inessential.com/2000/08/31.php">Frank, a fable</a>.
