I&#8217;ve been thinking about advertising recently. So when PerversionTracker, one of my favorite sites, <a href="http://perversiontracker.com/archives/000077.html">posted their advertising offer</a>, I jumped on it.</p>

<p>If you look at the bottom of the <a href="http://perversiontracker.com/archives/000078.html">review for Xupport 1.2.7</a>, you&#8217;ll see a little text ad for NetNewsWire. I tried to come up with a slogan that would fit in with the site.</p>

<p><em>NetNewsWire: It&#8217;s Not Metal&trade;</em></p>

<p>So, anyway, I was wondering about how advertising is changing in the weblog age.</p>

<p>One thing that&#8217;s important to me is that ads should be clearly marked as ads. (And my ad on PerversionTracker is clearly marked.)</p>

<p>But what do you think of the whole topic?</p>

<p>When a software vendor has a little extra money to spend on advertising, what&#8217;s cool to do and what&#8217;s not cool to do?</p>

<p>Is it a good idea for software vendors to spend at least a little money on the weblogs and news sites in their ecosystem?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not about to go on a spending spree. But it&#8217;s not too early to start thinking about these things.
