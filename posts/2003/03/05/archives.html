I was recently going through the office closet and dealing with old hard drives. I found some weird old graphics from like 1996.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know what InnerWeb was supposed to be&#8212;but it&#8217;s a tracing of my head.</p>

<p>A friend of mine was working on starting an Internet caf&#233;, and this was part of some website graphics we were working on. (The caf&#233; didn&#8217;t happen.)</p>

<p>We were working on a product named Scramble at some point. It didn&#8217;t ship. I don&#8217;t remember what it was going to be.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a metal thing. I think it&#8217;s a piece from a lighter. I have no idea what the point is here.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an old-fashioned Home button.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a six-shooter. To be used on only the nastiest of bugs.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a weird 3D thing.</p>
