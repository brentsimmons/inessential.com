<img src="http://inessential.com/images/labels.png" align="right" height="181" width="202" alt="screen shot of labels menu" />There’s a piece of software I use that has this Labels menu that freaks me out.</p>

<p>It’s okay until I look at the Yellow label. Then it becomes like one of those weird left-brain/right-brain experiments. I can feel the conflict in my head. It’s like a denial-of-service attack—my brain goes into a loop.</p>

<p>I don’t know how this happened—I don’t recall ever customizing anything label-related.
