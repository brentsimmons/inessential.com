Richard Soderberg figured out how put <a href="http://www.crystalflame.net/2003/12/rss_with_css.html">CSS in RSS</a>. And <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/12/30/css_in_rss_feed.html">Joi Ito</a> is using this technique in his <a href="feed:joi.ito.com/index.xml">feed</a>.</p>

<p>Some people think it’s cool, others don’t. I suspect an obvious feature request will be for aggregators to notice when this technique is being used and be able to turn it on and off.
