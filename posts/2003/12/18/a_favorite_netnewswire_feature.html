One of my favorite NetNewsWire features is not new in 1.0.7, but I suspect many people don’t know about it.</p>

<p>When reading the new-headlines feed or a group, you can delete read items by typing the letter d. (Just d, no modifier.) (Or choose Delete Read Items from the News menu; or type option-cmd-K.)</p>

<p>It’s just a little thing, but I find it very useful.</p>

<p>You can find more keyboard shortcuts like that by choosing Keyboard Shortcuts from the Help menu.
