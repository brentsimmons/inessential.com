<p>In the process of working on 1.1, we fixed a mach port leak and some performance bugs, and we didnâ€™t want to wait until 1.1 before making these fixes available, so we decided to do a 1.0.7 release.</p>

<p>1.0.7 also contains a few of the smaller features that were planned for 1.1: a new <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/features/widescreenview.php">widescreen view</a> is especially suited to laptops; <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/features/favicons.php">favicons</a> are now displayed in the Subscriptions pane; NetNewsWire now responds to the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/features/quicksubscribing.php">feed URL scheme</a>.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire107.php">change notes</a> for more new features and bug fixes.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/featureschart107.php">features chart</a> comparing NetNewsWire and NetNewsWire Lite has been updated.
