<p>I’m old enough to remember when it was new. My arcade-playing days predate the first-person games—for me, arcade games are about shooting things in outer space. Controlling a human walking around with a gun seems so mundane and puny. I need rockets and ray guns.</p>

<p>I was a big fan of Galaga and Asteroids too, and I’ve spent many hours playing <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/games/swoop/">Swoop</a> and <a href="http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/Maelstrom/">Maelstrom</a>.</p>

<p>Another favorite was Missile Command. Does anyone know of a good OS X version of Missile Command?
