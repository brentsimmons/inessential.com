As a boy living just outside Newark, Delaware my favorite college team was the Fightin’ Blue Hens. I remember well when they won the Division II championship.</p>

<p>I also remember hating their various rivals—Temple, Lehigh, Villanova, and, most especially, <em>Colgate</em>.</p>

<p>Gimme a C! Gimme an O! Gimme an L! Gimme a G! Gimme an A! Gimme a T! Gimme an E!</p>

<p>What does that spell?</p>

<p>Toothpaste!</p>

<p>Anyway, now the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=1685507">Hens will face Colgate</a> in the Division I-AA championship this Friday.</p>

<p>Go Blue Hens!</p>

<p>(It’s not lost on me that a fightin’ blue hen doesn’t sound as ferocious as a lion or a bear. Oh well. I probably shouldn’t mention, but I will, that the football team for the nearby high school is the Ballard Beavers. “You better get outta my way Mr. linebacker or I swear I’m gonna build a dam in this creek.”)
