I was thinking about what if cats wrote Christmas carols.</p>

<p>It came upon a midnight fish...<br />
Good King Wenceslas looked down<br />
on the fish of Stephen...<br />
Jingle fish, jingle fish...<br />
Away in a manger,<br />
no crib for a fish...<br /></p>

<p>My favorite:</p>

<p>Silent fish, holy fish<br />
All is calm, all is fish
