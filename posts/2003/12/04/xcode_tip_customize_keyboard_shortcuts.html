One thing that always bugged me about Project Builder is that there were no keyboard shortcuts for the most common source code management commands.</p>

<p>The commands I use most often are Compare with Latest and Commit Changes. It was such a pain to have to actually use my mouse. Hey! I’m a programmer! Don’t make me take my fingers off the keyboard!</p>

<p>Anyway... In Xcode you can now customize the list of keyboard shortcuts. So I gave Compare with Latest cmd-option-L and Commit Changes cmd-option-C.</p>

<p>That took away the pain of doing cvs stuff. And now, I’m happy to report, the sky is bluer and the air is fresher.
