I’m <em>so</em> looking forward to <a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/">Battlestar Galactica</a>.</p>

<p>I was about 10 years old when the original series premiered. I had already seen Star Wars of course and I was a big Star Trek fan (there was only the original series in those days; I’m not sure if even the first movie had come out yet).</p>

<p>I loved Battlestar Galactica. Space! Space battles! Lasers! Really fast and noisy space fighters equipped with lasers!</p>

<p>I was sad when it was cancelled.</p>

<p>(Another space show I loved was a sitcom: <a href="http://home.globalcrossing.net/~luethy/">Quark</a>, starring Richard Benjamin and John Candy. Nobody remembers it these days.)</p>

<p>I’ve read a bit about how purists are upset that the new version of BG changes a bunch of stuff. Me, I’m cool with it. It’s just TV.</p>

<p>It seems a bit more grown-up-ified. More babes and more philosophy.</p>

<p>But I find myself looking forward to it much the same way I did when I was 10 years old. Space! Space battles! Lasers!</p>

<p>I’m easy to please.</p>

<p>One thing has stuck around with me since the original series: sometimes when I get mad, instead of cursing I say <em>felgercarb</em>. Felgercarb was a made-up curse word from the future.</p>

<p>This makes me a hopeless geek, I know.</p>

<p>(My guess is that felgercarb refers to carbonized felger, the waste product of robots.) (I’m joking.)
