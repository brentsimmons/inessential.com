Sheila and I were so excited when we heard that NetNewsWire had <a href="http://ranchero.com/2003/12/03.php">won an Eddy</a>. Imagine us jumping up and down in our little office, with our cat Papa wondering why the monkeys had suddenly gone crazy.</p>

<p>We got the news about a week ago, but then had to wait for the press release to appear before saying anything. But knowing about it made for an extra-nice Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Huge thanks go to everyone who has supported NetNewsWire by using it, buying it, telling other people about it, sending feedback, making feature requests, and submitting bug reports. Youâ€™re what makes the difference between so-so software and Eddy-winning software. So: thank <em>you</em> very much.
