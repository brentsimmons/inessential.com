I&#8217;ve gotten a couple more good questions about my participation in the RSS advisory board. I&#8217;ll answer them here:</p>

<p>1. Will NetNewsWire support Echo?</p>

<p>If/when Echo is ready, NetNewsWire will support it.</p>

<p>In fact, my plan is to go a step further and create a plugin interface for NetNewsWire, so that developers can add support for other formats too, even non-XML formats. </p>

<p>Just because I&#8217;m on the RSS advisory board doesn&#8217;t mean I see this all as some kind of war. I&#8217;m no soldier. My focus remains making software that people like.</p>

<p>2. Why did I jump in the fray?</p>

<p>As stated above, I don&#8217;t think of this as a war. But that there has been conflict between some people about syndication standards is undeniable.</p>

<p>I consider the move and re-licensing of the RSS spec a move away from conflict. That&#8217;s a good thing.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a difference between being an RSS advocate, which I am, and an RSS absolutist, which I am not.
