UserLand has <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/announceRss2">transferred ownership</a> of its RSS 2.0 spec to Berkman. The <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss">spec</a> is now licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution/Share Alike license. An <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/advisoryBoard">advisory board</a> was formed to support and advocate RSS.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s where I come in: I&#8217;m on the advisory board. Its initial members are <a href="http://scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a>, <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/">Jon Udell</a>, and me.</p>

<p>I think this is a very good move for RSS.</p>

<p>Dan Gillmor has a good overview in <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001195.shtml#001195">RSS Moves a Step Forward</a>.</p>

<p>Two questions have come up so far regarding my participation in the advisory board. I&#8217;ll answer them:</p>

<p>1. Do I own stock in UserLand?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>2. Given that I used to work for UserLand, will I be independent, or will I vote as Dave votes?</p>

<p>I have and will continue to vote independently.</p>

<p>If you want some evidence of my independence, an obvious thing is that NetNewsWire and Radio UserLand are competing products. Both are RSS aggregators; both run on OS X. They work together, too&#8212;you can post to a Radio weblog from NetNewsWire&#8212;but NetNewsWire also works in the same way with Blogger, Blosxom, Movable Type, and other systems.</p>

<p>I could go on, but I hope that&#8217;s enough.</p>

<p>If you have other questions about my participation, please feel free to email me or add a comment to this site.
