Now and again I notice that people don&#8217;t know this about Safari&#8212;you <em>can</em> get URLs displayed when mousing over a link. It&#8217;s just turned off by default. (Maybe that&#8217;s changed for 1.0.)</p>

<p>From the View menu, choose Status Bar. That will give you a status bar that displays URLs like in other web browsers.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s very weird I think to have this feature turned off by default. It&#8217;s such a standard part of web browser UI.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s also a very Apple thing to do. They must have decided it&#8217;s a power-user feature, that most people don&#8217;t look at the URLs when hovering over links. They may be right.
