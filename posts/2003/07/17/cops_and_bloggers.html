Scott Johnson, Feedster guy, asks <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/2003/07/17.html#a1892">What If I Winer Watched You</a>? In other words, Feedster could track edits for every weblog in a way similar to Mark Pilgrim&#8217;s Winer Watcher.</p>

<p>I wrote on the comments for his post: &#8220;Do we really need to turn the blogosphere into a police state?&#8221;</p>

<p>I want people to read my weblog, but I don&#8217;t want my weblog to be an object of surveillance. Yes, the technology makes it possible, and probably pretty easy, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we need to use it this way.</p>

<p>Beware of the impulse toward becoming an accountability cop.
