Sheila and I watched <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/Queer_Eye_for_the_Straight_Guy/">Queer Eye for the Straight Guy</a> last night&#8212;both episodes&#8212;and <em>loved</em> it.</p>

<p>I love make-over shows. <a href="http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/tradingspaces/tradingspaces.html">Trading Spaces</a> and <a href="http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/whatnottowear/whatnottowear.html">What not to Wear</a> are two faves. But if I see that Oprah or anybody else is doing a make-over show, I&#8217;ll watch. I have to.</p>

<p>Make-overs are magic transformations. With just mundane tools&#8212;scissors and mousse, or hammers and saws, depending on the type of make-over&#8212;the best magic happens. People turn into their better selves, their happier, more confident selves.</p>

<p>Call it shallow, and I&#8217;ll remind you that Oscar Wilde said it&#8217;s only shallow people who don&#8217;t judge by appearances. So it&#8217;s shallow, but it&#8217;s also powerful.</p>

<p>And the Fab 5, the group of gay men who transform the straight guy and his home and his manners, they get this. To see them at the end so happy for the man they transformed&#8212;and to see the man happy&#8212;well, it would bring a tear to me eye if I weren&#8217;t straight.
