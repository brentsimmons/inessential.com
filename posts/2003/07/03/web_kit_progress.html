I&#8217;ve been working on getting Web Kit into NetNewsWire. It&#8217;s going pretty well. Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/webkitprogress1.jpg">screen shot</a> of it in use with the Combined View.</p>

<p>There are still some bugs. It&#8217;s not ready for testing yet, but it&#8217;s getting there. I&#8217;ve been very pleased with how easy Web Kit is. So far so good, anyway.</p>

<p>The screen shot looks much like non-Web-Kit screen shots of the Combined View&#8212;except for one major difference: right-aligned images actually appear on the right, as they should.
