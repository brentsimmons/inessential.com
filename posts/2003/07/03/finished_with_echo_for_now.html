I&#8217;m spending too much time on Echo, and I&#8217;m disappointed with it. The momentum is definitely with people who think of weblog syndication and editing as a blank slate.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s okay, I guess, but it&#8217;s a bad use of my time. So I&#8217;m going to pull back for now. Once Echo is ready I&#8217;ll support it in NetNewsWire.
