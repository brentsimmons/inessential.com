I wrote the other day how I was mad at Blogger because people were having trouble posting to Blogger from NetNewsWire.</p>

<p>Then today I was contacted by Steve Jenson (from Blogger) about the problem, and now it&#8217;s fixed.</p>

<p>I had wrongly assumed that it had to do with their sites and servers moving around. (Since that was in fact causing some temporary problems a little while ago.)</p>

<p>I was wrong. It turns out that it was a bug.</p>

<p>So I sent Steve the info to reproduce it, and now the bug is fixed.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>What this means: if you&#8217;ve been having trouble posting to a Blogger weblog from NetNewsWire&#8212;if you&#8217;ve been getting an error message that says something about a Java NullPointerException&#8212;then it should work now.</p>

<p>If you still have trouble posting to Blogger, please send me email with what you tried and what error message you got.
