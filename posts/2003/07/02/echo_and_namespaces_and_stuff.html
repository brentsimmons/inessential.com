I&#8217;ve been looking around more at the Echo wiki&#8212;and I&#8217;m happy to find things that could go either way and I don&#8217;t care.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/NamespaceDiscussion">Namespaces</a>, for instance. I find namespaces cluttery, but I recognize that they can have value as an extension mechanism. So either way is fine by me.</p>

<p>Another thing is&#8212;should Echo be <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/MultipleSyntaxDiscussion">XML only</a>? I would naturally say yes, and I expect most people would say yes. But even if something other than XML is permitted, no one who cares about interoperability would implement it, so it doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>

<p>The question on whether the Echo data model should be an <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/InfoSetDiscussion">InfoSet</a> seems not to be hotly debated. Good, because I don&#8217;t even know what an InfoSet is.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m in the minority on the <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/EscapedHtmlDiscussion">Escaped HTML Discussion</a>. I think HTML and XHTML should be escaped. But I can hack my way around this issue. (I think that proponents of inline XHTML are wildly optimistic. If inline XHTML is used extensively, then there&#8217;s going to be a huge problem with non-well-formed feeds.)
