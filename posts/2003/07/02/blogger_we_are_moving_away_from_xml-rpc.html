The Blogger folks posted a <a href="http://www.blogger.com/developers/2003_07_01_archive.pyra#105711794730830300">Blogger API Update</a>. The gist of it: they will continue to support the Blogger 1.0 API, and they will also support Echo in the future.</p>

<p>Okay, that makes sense. It&#8217;s not my personal preference, but it makes sense.</p>

<p>One thing kinda pissed me off: &#8220;We are moving away from XML-RPC,&#8221; they write.</p>

<p>The thing is, I&#8217;ve already been so pissed at Blogger lately. They&#8217;ve been moving servers and sites around, and their support for the Blogger API keeps breaking, so I have a bunch of people sending me bug reports about null Java exceptions and stuff&#8212;errors on the Blogger side when people try to post to their weblogs.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been so bad that I even thought about dropping support for Blogger in NetNewsWire&#8217;s weblog editor. But I won&#8217;t do that because there are people who bought NetNewsWire to edit their Blogger weblogs, and these people are far more important than my being pissed off at Blogger.</p>

<p>The Blogger folks continue: &#8220;If you choose to take advantage of the capabilities of the new API, you will need to use SOAP instead of XML-RPC. This was a difficult decision (made collectively by the designers of Echo), because there is a lot of investment in XML-RPC in the blogging tool space, and it is great for getting things done quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Okay, if this is true, I totally missed it. My fault. Will the Echo API mandate SOAP rather than XML-RPC?</p>

<p>It seems like my to-do list is getting longer every day with crap. I want to do bug fixes and cool new features (Web Kit, synching, Rendezvous support, etc.). I don&#8217;t want to have to deal with SOAP. Feh.</p>

<p>A new syndication format, okay, a new editing API, okay, but now I have to use SOAP?</p>

<p>From the user&#8217;s point of view, they just want to be able to use titles with their Blogger posts. Seems like it should be simple.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll use SOAP if I have to. Of course I will.</p>

<p>I keep seeing phrases like &#8220;benefits to users and developers...&#8221; Which makes me laugh. </p>

<p>The Ministry of Benefits to Developers and Users&#8212;where &#8220;benefits to developers&#8221; means you have to do a bunch of extra work on things that you already had nailed down. Where &#8220;benefits to users&#8221; means users have to wait for the features they&#8217;re excited about because the developers are too busy dealing with all the wonderful &#8220;benefits&#8221; they&#8217;re having to support.
