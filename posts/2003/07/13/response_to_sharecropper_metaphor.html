I like Tim Bray and Robb Beal&#8212;but I don&#8217;t like the <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/12/WebsThePlace">sharecropper metaphor</a> they use to describe developers who write apps for specific operating systems.</p>

<p>Me, I write Web-related desktop apps for OS X. Because:</p>

<p>1. I like the Web.</p>

<p>2. I like desktop apps.</p>

<p>3. I like OS X.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not unobservant, though&#8212;I know the operating system vendor has a great deal of power. And that the relationship between OS vendor and developer is a symbiotic relationship.</p>

<p>However, to think of myself as a sharecropper would be to insult myself and what I do.</p>

<p>Sharecropper implies a level of poverty, captivity, and hopelessness that&#8217;s not remotely applicable. I make money from NetNewsWire sales. I&#8217;m smart, skilled, and nimble&#8212;if I want to or need to come up with a new app or switch to a different OS, I will. I&#8217;m not stuck with a single square patch of dirt.</p>

<p>I love doing what I&#8217;m doing: I love writing Web-related desktop apps for OS X. But, more than that, I love writing software that people like.</p>

<p>The metaphor I use is the metaphor of dinosaurs and the early mammals. The dinosaurs were slow and heavy. The mammals had to watch out where the dinosaurs stepped. The dinosaurs probably didn&#8217;t even notice most of the time when they stepped on a mammal.</p>

<p>But then the mammals ate dinosaur eggs. They were faster and smarter. And the mammals survived quite well.
