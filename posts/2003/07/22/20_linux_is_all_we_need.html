<a href="http://newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=03/07/15/140205">20% Linux is all we need</a>, writes Robin &#8216;Roblimo&#8217; Miller. Let&#8217;s &#8220;think rationally about what percentage of the world&#8217;s desktops we really need to switch to Linux. I figure 10% would be a minimum, and 20% would be more than enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>When articles about Linux desktops come up, I usually read them, because in the back of my mind is the thought that a Linux port of NetNewsWire would be fun to do. (I like Linux. I even like Linux desktops, now that the font situation is improving.)</p>

<p>Miller continues: &#8220;One factor that may slow the adoption of Linux by consumer and small office-oriented software vendors is the perception of Linux users as freebie-hustlers who refuse to pay for software.&#8221;</p>

<p>That puts it bluntly. It&#8217;s an accurate statement: there <em>is</em> that perception. I myself have that perception, which is why I haven&#8217;t ever come close to breaking ground on a Linux version of NetNewsWire.</p>

<p>Am I wrong? (I&#8217;m no stranger to being wrong.)
