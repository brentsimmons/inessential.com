I&#8217;ve been reading this book on Western history: it&#8217;s a general, chronological textbook, starting with the earliest Tigris and Euphrates civilizations and continuing to the near-present.</p>

<p>I just got to the Renaissance last night. Wow! It&#8217;s like fireworks going off.</p>

<p>If I had to write a capsule history of Western civilization, it would go like this:</p>

<p>Prehistory. Then the explosion of philosophy and art in Greece and Rome. Then a long period of near-total forgetting. Then the Renaissance!
