It&#8217;s starting to look like there are two ways to deal with the issue. They may co-exist&#8212;in fact, I&#8217;m leaning toward doing both.</p>

<p>1. A pref that allows you to include updated items when going to the previous/next unread item.</p>

<p>In other words, if you hit the space bar, the next item might be an updated item or it might be an unread item.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a simple solution&#8212;but if you turn it on it means you&#8217;d end up seeing all the little typo fixes updates.</p>

<p>2. An algorithm for determining significant updates. This should be more complex than just a change in length.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/">Manton Reece</a> suggested among other things that counting the number of links in a description is a good idea&#8212;a change in links is probably a significant change, more than just a typo fix. In other words, descriptions aren&#8217;t just any old text, they&#8217;re text that often contains links, and should be analyzed that way. (They&#8217;re also generally made up of sentences and paragraphs, as opposed to C code or something like that.)</p><h4>What about an HTML diff view?</h4><p><a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/">Aaron Swartz</a> suggested that an HTML diff view would be cool for updated items. And I agree&#8212;at least as an option for power users. But the HTML display of updated items is a different issue than whether or not you get to them via the space bar.
