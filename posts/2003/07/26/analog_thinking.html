I read with some happiness today that <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.08/view.html?pg=3">Marvin Minsky</a> declared Artificial Intelligence research &#8220;brain-dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>You&#8217;re going to think I&#8217;m weird. Maybe this is surprising coming from a computer programmer.</p>

<p>But listen, the only thing that makes microprocessors tolerable is that they don&#8217;t really think.</p>

<p>On Thursday Robert Scoble wrote about how <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/07/24.html#a3898">analog thinking</a> is Microsoft&#8217;s biggest enemy. And the biggest enemy of Linux and so on.</p>

<p>As I read that, I was thinking about how much I love pen and paper. And record albums. And shoes. And grass.</p>

<p>The analog world is made up of atoms of poetry. The digital world is made up of bits.
