<a href="http://www.itopik.com/newsreaders/reviews/nnw/">Dan Shafer reviewed NetNewsWire</a> on itopik.com. (And he mentioned some nits, which we&#8217;re working on.)</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.itopik.com/newsreaders/">list of newsreaders</a> there and people can post reviews. Dan&#8217;s appears to be the first review: it would be cool if there more. (Not just of NetNewsWire, I mean, but of all newsreaders.)
