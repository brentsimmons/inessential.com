I&#8217;m reading a book about the history of Western civilization. It&#8217;s an old textbook left over from my college days that didn&#8217;t get much use.</p>

<p>(I love reading history, so yes, this is just something I&#8217;m doing for fun.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve hit a snag. I&#8217;m reading about the early Byzantine Empire now. And I can&#8217;t focus because I keep hearing in my head at max volume the classic They Might Be Giants song:</p>

<p><pre>Istanbul was Constantinople
Now it&#8217;s Istanbul not Constantinople
Been a long time gone Constantinople
Now a Turkish delight on a moonlit night</pre></p>

<p>Help!</p>

<p>By the way: before it was Constantinople it was Byzantium. But that would have just complicated the song. Constantine originally called it New Rome, but that didn&#8217;t stick: they called it City of Constantine, Constantinople.
