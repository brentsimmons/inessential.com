<a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php">NetNewsWire 1.0.6b1</a> has been posted. We decided to a quick 1.0.6 before doing 1.1.</p>

<p>It has just one purpose: to fix a specific performance bug. It may be fixed in this beta—but more testing is needed.</p>

<p>The bug is that while refreshing sometimes the HTML descriptions appear very slowly. This can make it difficult to read news while a refresh is going on.</p>

<p>If you’ve noticed this, then please try the beta and let me know one way or the other. Is the problem fixed (or at least much improved)? Or not fixed? Or made worse?</p>

<p>Thanks!
