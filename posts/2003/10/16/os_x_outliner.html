I’m trying to decide on an outliner to use on OS X. <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/">OmniOutliner</a> came with my new computer, and there’s alot to like about it. But it doesn’t suit me perfectly, either.</p>

<p>If you use an outliner, which one? And why do you prefer it?</p>

<p>Me, I’m tempted to use <a href="http://www.outliners.com/more31">MORE</a>, because I still like it better than anything else I’ve tried, but I really don’t want to install Classic, so I probably won’t use MORE.
