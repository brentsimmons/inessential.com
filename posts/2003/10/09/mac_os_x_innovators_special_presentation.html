At the upcoming O’Reilly Mac OS X conference there will be a <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/developer/2003/10/09/innovators.html">special presentation</a> of the winners of the third Mac OS X Innovators contest.</p>

<p>I’ll be there along with some other past winners—Robb Beal, Gus Mueller, and folks from Rogue Amoeba Software—to talk about the current status of our apps and to answer questions about developing for OS X.
