I’ve got a new laptop on the way—and I was wondering, for all you folks who have a desktop and a laptop, how do you deal with email?</p>

<p>I’d like to be able to be able to read and send email from both computers without going through the hassle of copying files across.</p>

<p>One possibility I’m considering is running pine or mutt on my desktop, and ssh’ing in to my desktop from the laptop. But then I would miss out on the utility of being able to have two message windows open. And I’d not be able to sleep my desktop when I’m using my laptop.</p>

<p>It should be noted that I have a POP account.</p>

<p>So—if you’re in this situation, what do <em>you</em> do?
