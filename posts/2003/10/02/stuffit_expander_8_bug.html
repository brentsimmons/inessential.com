Since the release a few days ago of Stuffit Expander 8, we’ve been getting email about how freshly downloaded apps won’t launch.</p>

<p>The Aladdin folks put up a <a href="http://www.aladdinsys.com/support/techsupport/qanda.php?id=534&sessionid=31375">page</a> about this issue.</p>

<p>We’re probably going to switch to using gzip compression rather than Stuffit compression.
