Like <a href="http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2003/10/10.html#944">Gus Mueller</a>, I ended up as Jean-Luc Picard in the “Which Fantasy/SciFi Character are You?” <a href="http://www.tk421.net/character/">test</a>.</p>

<p>If I hadn’t ended up as Picard, I probably wouldn’t have admitted taking the test. If you ever want to or need to flatter a geek, call him Jean-Luc. Geeks are so easy.
