At the moment I’m adding a bunch of small features to NetNewsWire that will appear in the 1.1 release. There will be large features too, but at the moment I’m working on small things.</p>

<p>So—what small features would you like to see added to NetNewsWire? What little things would make it work better for you?</p>

<p>(Things like synching, Rendezvous, persistence and so on are large features. Small features are things like new keyboard shortcuts and little UI enhancements.)
