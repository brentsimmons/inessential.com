We’ve posted a new beta: <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php">NetNewsWire Lite 1.0.5b1</a>. The idea is to bring the Lite version up-to-date with the changes in the full version.</p>

<p>It uses Web Kit for HTML rendering, supports custom style sheets, supports gzip compression, and so on. Lots of bugs were fixed. See the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/lite105.php">change notes</a> for more details.</p>

<p>We’re looking for deal-stopper bugs. We plan to release the finished version next week.
