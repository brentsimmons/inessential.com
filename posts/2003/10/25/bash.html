I did clean installs of Panther, so I got the defaults of everything, and I discovered that the default shell in Panther is bash!</p>

<p>Given the popularity of bash on Linux that’s probably the right choice. But I’ve been using tcsh since the OS X public beta, and I don’t want to switch.</p>

<p>So, easily enough, I changed my shell to tcsh. In case you’re wondering how to do this, here’s what I did: in NetInfo Manager I navigated to <code>/users/brent</code>, then clicked the lock to make changes, then set the value of the shell property to <code>/bin/tcsh</code>, then I logged out then back in.</p>
