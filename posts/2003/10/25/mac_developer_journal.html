Somehow I missed hearing about the new magazine <a href="http://www.macdeveloperjournal.com/">Mac Developer Journal</a> until today. Sounds pretty cool.</p>

<p>A sample article is on-line: <a href="http://www.macdeveloperjournal.com/issue1/applescript/pg01.html">Add Features Fast with AppleScript Studio</a> by Sal Soghoian. Itâ€™s about how you can add features to your application by running AppleScript scripts.
