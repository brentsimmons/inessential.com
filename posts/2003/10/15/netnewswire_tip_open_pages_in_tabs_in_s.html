I’ve posted this NetNewsWire tip before, but I repeat it now and again because new users don’t necessarily know it.</p>

<p>You can make it so that when you open links from NetNewsWire, the pages open in new tabs in Safari. The benefit to this is that you can go through your news, opening links as you go, and at the end switch over to Safari.</p>

<p>Here’s how:</p>

<p>1. Open Safari’s preferences window.</p>

<p>2. Click the General toolbar icon. At the bottom of the window, tell it to open links from applications in the current window.</p>

<p>3. Click the Tabs toolbar icon. Check the box for “Enable Tabbed Browsing.”</p>

<p>Now whenever you open a link from NetNewsWire (or any other app) it will open in a new tab in Safari.
