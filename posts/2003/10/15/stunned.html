The eighth inning of the Cubs game yesterday stunned me. Sheila said that she had never seen a curse in action before.</p>

<p>I was born in Chicago, so I have some small reason for rooting for the Cubs. Part of me wants to root for the Marlins, because I like Pudge so much and I think the Rangers treated him shabbily. But they’ve won the Series recently and the Cubs very much haven’t.
