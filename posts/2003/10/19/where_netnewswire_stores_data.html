When you’re upgrading to a new version of OS X, and you want to make sure NetNewsWire doesn’t lose its subscriptions and preferences, you need to copy two things to your new installation:</p>

<p>1. The preferences file at ~/Library/Preferences/com.ranchero.NetNewsWire.plist</p>

<p>2. The folder at ~/Library/Application Support/NetNewsWire/</p>

<p>The prefs file contains your subscriptions and other preferences. The folder in the Application Support folder contains the database which remembers which items have been read, the disk cache, the Notepad file, Scripts menu scripts, and possibly some other things.</p>

<p>(I’m posting this because I’ve heard from a few people and seen <a href="http://iheartmena.typepad.com/weblog/2003/10/the_silence_is_.html">one mention</a> on the web about people not knowing what they need to copy over to their new operating system.)</p>

<p>Also, both <a href="http://www.macnightowl.com/newsletters/2003/10/203.htm#adopter">Mac Night Owl</a> and <a href="http://www.whiterabbits.com/macnetjournal/October2003.html#note_1889">Mac Net Journal</a> have posted some good general tips about upgrading. My personal opinion: make backups and go slowly. Your data is too important to lose.
