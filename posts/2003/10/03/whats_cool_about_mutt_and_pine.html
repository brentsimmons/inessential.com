In the <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=2653">comments</a> for my previous post about email on two computers, Jerry wrote: “Anything to avoid mutt and pine; they should be permanently retired along with POP accounts.”</p>

<p>I disagree about mutt and pine. In fact, I’m strongly considering switching to one of those two. (I’ve been a pine user in the past, but mutt interests me.)</p>

<p>Mutt and pine have a few of the most important features of my dream email client:</p>

<p>1. Navigating through the mailbox list can be done via keyboard—no mouse required.</p>

<p>2. Transferring a message to a mailbox can also be done with just the keyboard.</p>

<p>3. HTML and text styling is not respected at all.</p>

<p>For example: several times a week I have to copy and paste a styled email from Mail into BBEdit just to be able to read it, since the font size is too small. BBEdit makes it plain text, so it’s in a readable size (a size that I myself set). An email app that does plain text only in the first place would be better.</p>

<p>So... it’s all about spending less time managing email. Anything that can make it faster and easier is a good thing.
