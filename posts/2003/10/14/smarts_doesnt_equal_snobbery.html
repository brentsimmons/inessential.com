<a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=2662">Yesterday</a> I wrote about how Democrats come across as too snobby to be the party of the average guy, and that Republicans have taken over this position.</p>

<p>Some of the reaction to this was people saying that they’re not ashamed of being intelligent and it’s sad that intelligence is a liability.</p>

<p>I agree with that, but I don’t think that’s really the issue.</p>

<p>I think of Bill Clinton. In terms of raw intelligence, he was probably in the top tier of American presidents. But we saw him struggle with weight: he liked McDonald’s french fries. You could imagine that, if he weren’t so busy, he might enjoy watching wrestling on TV now and again. People called him Bubba.</p>

<p>Smart—yes, hugely smart—but no snob. He didn’t set himself apart from the mainstream of American culture, even its trashier parts. He was democratic in the broadest sense of the word.
