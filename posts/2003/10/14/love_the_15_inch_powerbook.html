So, my 15-inch PowerBook arrived a few days ago—and I love it. Fast processor, big sharp screen.</p>

<p>One of the nice things is that (through the magic of cvs) I can work on NetNewsWire on my laptop. My old laptop—one of the very old two-tone iBooks—was too slow and had too small a screen.</p>

<p>So I’m updating the Sites Drawer while watching the Red Sox and the Yankees. I’m rooting for the Sox. First because I wanted them to beat the A’s, because the A’s beat the Mariners to the division title, and in this series because I’m tired of seeing the Yankees win. (Like many Mac users I habitually root for the underdog.)</p>

<p>Go Red Sox!
