We posted both NetNewsWire and NetNewsWire Lite 1.0.6fc1 to the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php">betas page</a>.</p>

<p>The point behind 1.0.6 is to fix a performance bug where sometimes HTML descriptions would be slow to appear while a refresh is going on. Otherwise itâ€™s the same as 1.0.5. (Well, we updated the Sites Drawer too.)</p>

<p>Please report to me any deal-stoppers. Thanks!</p>

<p>Once 1.0.6 is out of the way, then the next thing is 1.1, which will have a bunch of new features.
