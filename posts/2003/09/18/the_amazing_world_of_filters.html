So last night I mentioned using /etc/hosts as a type of filter—and then I come in to work today and find that I need yet another filter, a comments filter.</p>

<p>Last night or this morning this site and ranchero.com got hit with a couple dozen comments spam posts with links to porn sites and such. I deleted them.</p>

<p>But I’m a little bugged about how filters—and places where filters are needed—are proliferating. I even have a filter for my referers page, which I update almost every day.</p>

<p>Spam, wherever it is—in email, web page pop-ups, comments, referers, and so on—isn’t marketing. It’s <em>malice</em>.
