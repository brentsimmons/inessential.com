The recent discussion on NetNewsWire and external links and permalinks led to the conclusion that the best thing is to provide a pref so that you can prefer one or the other. The default is to prefer permalinks. <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php">Check it out</a>.</p>

<p>Note that not all feeds provide both, so it’s truly a preference. If you prefer permalinks, but a feed doesn’t have permalinks, then you’ll get the external link. And vice versa.</p>

<p>Thanks to all the people who contributed to this discussion. This is yet another case where what I thought made the most sense wasn’t what most NetNewsWire users thought—and they convinced me. I’m happy to be wrong, especially when the outcome means the software is better.
