In a <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=2632">previous post</a> I talked about a bug in Web Kit. Here’s the deal: I love Web Kit. I think Mac developers have just begun to scratch the surface of what we can do with it. I know I have, anyway. (Just begun, that is.)</p>

<p>If there are bugs, that’s no surprise. It’s a new thing. (My software has bugs too.) It doesn’t take away from my appreciation for Web Kit.
