<a href="http://www.waferbaby.com/archives/03/09/07/reborn">waferbaby</a> has been reborn as a “unicode-savvy xsl application that just happens to have an xhtml interface (this site).”</p>

<p>One thing that I really like—each page is also an RSS feed. Just change the host from www.waferbaby.com to rss.waferbaby.com.
