I’m trying to do a page for people who want to edit <a href="http://www.pmachine.com/">pMachine</a> weblogs with NetNewsWire. I’m having a problem—I can’t figure out how to find out the Blog ID.</p>

<p>Does anyone know?</p>

<p>I found <a href="http://www.pmachine.com/docs/manual.html#bloggerapi">this page</a> on figuring out the RPC URL. The Blog ID is the only unknown piece.</p>

<p>(I would just download pMachine and figure it out, but the terms of use don’t allow for people doing apps that interface with pMachine.)
