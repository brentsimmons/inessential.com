Since posting the other day about <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=2637">RSS and style sheets</a>—making it so people could create a style sheet to use with their feeds—I’ve come to learn that people hate the idea.</p>

<p>Fine by me!</p>

<p>So what are some other good ideas for dealing with what Steven Frank calls the <a href="http://stevenf.com/mt/archives/000437.php">facelessness</a> of RSS feeds? (User interface mockups are especially welcome.)
