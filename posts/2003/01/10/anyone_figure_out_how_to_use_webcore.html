Has anyone figured out how to use WebCore yet?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m finding the same things already reported at the <a href="http://blog.oops.se/cocoa/">Oops Cocoa Blog</a>&#8212;that what we need is WebKit or similar. (WebKit is part of Safari: it uses WebCore.)</p>

<p>Otherwise I&#8217;ve made better progress with Gecko. I&#8217;d rather use the faster and smaller Safari renderer in NetNewsWire. But I can actually get Gecko to work, and I haven&#8217;t been able to get WebCore to work. (At least not yet.)</p>

<p>I suppose I could always use Gecko at first, then switch to WebCore at some later date.
