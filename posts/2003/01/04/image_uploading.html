An extension to the various weblog APIs that I&#8217;d love to see would be easy image uploading.</p>

<p>Not just images, but movies, Flash files, etc.</p>

<p>I get lots of requests for that as a feature to add to NetNewsWire. Unfortunately there isn&#8217;t a common API similar to the <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi">MetaWeblog API</a> for uploading media files to weblogs.</p>

<p>But hey, listen&#8212;webloggers (at least some of them) really want this.
