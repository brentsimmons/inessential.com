<a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/archives/2003_01.html#001733">Dave Hyatt</a> (Safari guy): &#8220;If you&#8217;re trying to embed the Safari layout engine right now, stop it! :)&#8221;</p>

<p>Done!</p>

<p>Actually, I stopped a few days ago. A real HTML renderer for NetNewsWire will have to wait until embedding the Safari renderer is actually do-able.</p>

<p>I strongly considered using Gecko, but it adds just a ton of size to the app&#8212;nearly 20MB. (Even stripped and optimized and all that.)
