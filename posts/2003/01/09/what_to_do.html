A couple people have sent me notes on how to change my CSS so my sites display in Safari. (Thanks!)</p>

<p>But now I&#8217;m in a weird position. Do I fix my sites so they render in Safari, or do I leave my sites as-is so the Safari folks can see them and fix the Safari bug?</p>

<p>I have a particular interest in being Safari-viewable, given that people reading this site are (mostly) Mac early-adopter types and they&#8217;re the ones most likely to use Safari.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you&#8217;re probably reading this in an RSS news reader. So I think I&#8217;ll leave my sites as-is for now. I think.
