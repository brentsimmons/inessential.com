There are two things people sometimes don&#8217;t notice about NetNewsWire.</p>

<p>1. The space bar works to go to the next unread headline. If the current headline needs to scroll (in the HTML view), it will scroll instead of going to the next unread headline. This way you can just motor through all the unread news by using the space bar.</p>

<p>2. You can organize subscriptions into groups. Choose New Group from the Subscriptions menu. Groups are like folders. You can drag subscriptions into a group.
