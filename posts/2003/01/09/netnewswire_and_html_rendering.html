A number of emails have asked me if NetNewsWire will use the new HTML rendering engine that Safari uses.</p>

<p>Great question.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to include a better HTML renderer in NetNewsWire, and perhaps even include a mini-browser as an option for viewing stories so you don&#8217;t have to jump to your web browser.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, the weekend before MacWorld I downloaded the Mozilla source to see how Gecko integration might work. As a test case I did a version of BlogBrowser that uses Gecko instead of Apple&#8217;s built-in HTML renderer. (The pre-Safari renderer.)</p>

<p>It worked wonderfully. Totally cool.</p>

<p>Except that <em>BlogBrowser was suddenly 258.8 MB in size</em>.</p>

<p>Holy frijoles!</p>

<p>Obviously there&#8217;s a way to strip that down, or else Chimera and Mozilla would be much huger than they are. (On my machine Chimera is 21.4 MB.)</p>

<p>Still, though, a rough guess tells me that adding the Gecko renderer would add ~15 MB to NetNewsWire&#8217;s size.</p>

<p>Safari, on the other hand, is 7.1 MB. Adding Safari&#8217;s renderer would add about 4 MB to NetNewsWire. A better choice in terms of size&#8212;and it appears that Safari&#8217;s renderer is faster, too.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Safari appears to do a less good job of rendering sites. My sites inessential.com and ranchero.com are totally broken in Safari. I don&#8217;t know why (yet)&#8212;maybe it&#8217;s a bug in my HTML or CSS, maybe not.</p>

<p>So... what does all this mean for NetNewsWire? No decisions yet. More investigation is needed.</p>

<p>I like very much that there&#8217;s a choice. Neither option is perfect. There are trade-offs.</p>

<p>But I prefer having a choice, with all its trade-offs, to having no choice.
