I&#8217;m not a fan of George Bush. But if he proposes a mission to Mars in his state of the Union speech&#8212;as the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/spacedocumentary/story/0,2763,877363,00.html">Guardian reports</a> he may do&#8212;then I still won&#8217;t be a fan of George Bush, but I&#8217;ll be hugely excited about the mission to Mars.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s time to do it. We&#8217;re way behind on space travel.
