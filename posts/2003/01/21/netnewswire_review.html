I love this <a href="http://rands.jerkcity.com/archives/000084.html">review of NetNewsWire</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I get really annoying when I find a new toy. I tell every person I know about it, I construct my day around it, and every answer to every question passes threw the new toy neuron in my head. This means if you ask me, &#8216;Hey Rands, what&#8217;s 7 + 3?&#8217; I first think, &#8216;How can the new toy help me answer this?&#8217; before I say, &#8216;10&#8217;.&#8221;
