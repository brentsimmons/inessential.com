Tim Bray: <a href="http://www.textuality.com/rss/RssFutures.html">Where Next for RSS</a>?</p>

<p>Good article. I have a few NetNewsWire-specific responses, of course.</p>

<p>1. The first issue Tim writes about is what to do when you&#8217;re away from your home machine. What about your RSS subscription list when you&#8217;re on a kiosk machine somewhere? There are lots of ways to solve this problem, and it&#8217;s definitely on my mind.</p>

<p>But first things first&#8212;shipping NetNewsWire Pro comes first.</p>

<p>2. Tim asks, &#8220;Why do I have to use a non-Web-browser to chase Web content?&#8221;</p>

<p>Web browsers aren&#8217;t always the most efficient means of viewing data. Check out <a href="http://www.karelia.com/watson/">Watson</a> (or Sherlock) to see what I mean.</p>

<p>I think what we&#8217;ll see is more applications using HTML rather than Web browsers including more applications.</p>

<p>3. A few notes about the traffic problem...</p>

<p>NetNewsWire supports ETag and last-modified headers to cut way down on the amount of bandwidth it uses. You can even look at your bandwidth use by choosing Show Bandwidth Stats from the View menu.</p>

<p>The Pro version of NetNewsWire caches feeds on disk, so it uses even less bandwidth.</p>

<p>Tim also writes: &#8220;There is going to be an ungodly traffic bulge every morning, and then at half-hour intervals all day.&#8221;</p>

<p>About the half-hour intervals&#8212;NetNewsWire does not update at :00 and :30 but at intervals since launch time. This staggers the traffic.
