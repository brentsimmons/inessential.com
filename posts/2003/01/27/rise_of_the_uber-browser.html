<a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/archives/2003_01.html#002403">Dave Hyatt</a> on browsers and RSS: &#8220;Now that I&#8217;ve started using NetNewsWire to read blogs, I find it frustrating to be constantly switching back and forth between NetNewsWire and Safari. This led me to wonder: should RSS capabilities and browsing capabilities be merged into a single &#8216;uber-browser&#8217; application?&#8221;</p>

<p>My opinion is, of course, no. NetNewsWire should use Safari&#8217;s renderer so you don&#8217;t have to switch to a browser (unless you want to).
