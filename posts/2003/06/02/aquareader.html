I stumbled across this yesterday.</p>

<p>In a recent interview I mis-remembered the original name of NetNewsWire (before anyone saw it) as CocoaWire&#8212;but I was wrong, its original name was AquaReader. (Which made me think of <a href="http://www.toonopedia.com/aquaman.htm">Aquaman</a> the superhero.)</p>

<p>Even just a year ago people were still naming their apps Cocoa-Something or Aqua-Something or Something-X to make it clear they were OS X apps. That was a pretty dorky thing to do.
