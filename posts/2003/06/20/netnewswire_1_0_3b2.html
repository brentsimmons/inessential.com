<a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php">NetNewsWire 1.0.3b2</a> fixes a bunch of different little things. It may be the last beta before 1.0.3 ships&#8212;which means we&#8217;re looking for deal-stoppers bugs.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire103.php">change notes</a> for details on what&#8217;s changed.</p>

<p>I always get a little anxious before a release&#8212;Oh no! It&#8217;s not perfect! There are still things to do!&#8212;but then I remind myself that there will be another release, and another, and another...</p>

<p>And if you don&#8217;t release you end up doing these infrequent, giant, would-be-utopia releases which really aren&#8217;t any better anyway than more frequent releases.</p><h4>Anyway...</h4><p>The big news in this beta is probably that LiveJournal has been added as a supported weblog system. (Thanks to the <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a> folks for adding Blogger API support.)</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a page on configuring NetNewsWire to <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/tips/livejournalconfig.php">edit a LiveJournal weblog</a>.
