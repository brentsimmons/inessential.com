A year ago I started a mailing list devoted to web services on OS X. It&#8217;s been largely inactive, but today people started talking about Web Kit there. That&#8217;s totally cool by me.</p>

<p>If you want to join, here&#8217;s its <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/osxweb/">home page</a> on Yahoo Groups.
