I&#8217;ve taken a look at <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/">Echo</a>. I even added my first comment, to the <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/EscapedHtmlDiscussion">escaped HTML discussion</a>.</p>

<p>I plan to support Echo in my software.</p>

<p>This is conditional of course on the final spec being deployable. But I expect it will be. This isn&#8217;t rocket science.</p>

<p>I took a look at a bunch of places where decisions have to be made, and realized that these decisions could go either way and we&#8217;d still end up with a deployable format.</p>

<p>The thing is, I&#8217;m still not convinced of the need for Echo. I&#8217;ve read pretty much everything I could find on the issue.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s just me. I&#8217;m often unconvinced of the rightness of an idea, but then it turns out to be a very good idea. Happens all the time.
