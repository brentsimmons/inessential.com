One of the reasons I&#8217;ve been looking forward to WWDC is to learn about WebKit. There&#8217;s a session on using WebKit in Cocoa apps, and that&#8217;s the one session I absolutely can&#8217;t miss.</p>

<p>NetNewsWire needs WebKit. It keeps asking me for it, and I have to say: sorry, not yet. Soon. (Imagine how cool the Combined View will be with WebKit.)</p>

<p>Anyway... while the rest of the Mac universe is looking at leaked G5 machine specs and things like that, I&#8217;m fixated on WebKit.</p>

<p>My guess is that WebKit will result in a bunch of new apps from lots of different developers. Having an easy-to-embed HTML renderer that comes with the system is a good thing for developers. It opens up lots of possibilities.</p>

<p>Of course, I expect there will be lots of experimental apps as a result of WebKit. Not everything will be good; not every idea will stick. But I bet there will be some gems.
