<p>The big new feature is the Combined View, which puts titles and descriptions together in a single pane. I&#8217;ve written about it many times here. I&#8217;ve also written about the other new feature, the ability to edit LiveJournal weblogs.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/whatsnew/netnewswire103.php">What&#8217;s New in NetNewsWire 1.0.3</a> for more details.</p>

<p>To celebrate the new features&#8212;and celebrate WWDC and the start of Summer&#8212;we&#8217;re running a <a href="https://order.kagi.com/cgi-bin/store.cgi?storeID=2DQ">25%-off sale</a>: NetNewsWire is $29.95 through the end of June.
