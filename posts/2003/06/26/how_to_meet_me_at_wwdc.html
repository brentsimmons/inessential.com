If I haven&#8217;t run into you yet at WWDC&#8212;I&#8217;ll be at or near the espresso machine on the 2nd level at 1:30. Today, Thursday. So come say hello!</p>

<p>(In case you hadn&#8217;t noticed the machine: it&#8217;s the big bronze-looking thing at the end farthest from the main entrance on the 2nd level.)</p>

<p>To make me easier to spot: I&#8217;m wearing black jeans and a light-colored button-down shirt. Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/mac/developer/2003/05/22/graphics/brent_simmons_web.jpg">picture</a> of me.
