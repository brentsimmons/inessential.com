I&#8217;ve gotten some email regarding <a href="http://intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/RoadMap">Echo</a>, a new format for weblogs. Unfortunately this whole thing came up as I was getting a new release of NetNewsWire out and then going to WWDC. I&#8217;ve had absolutely no time to read it.</p>

<p>And I probably won&#8217;t have time until I return from WWDC.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my general take:</p>

<p>I care about software, not specs. I have not a shred of idealism about specs. My support for standards is purely pragmatic. (In other words: I strongly support standards, but for pragmatic reasons.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;d rather spend my time fixing bugs and doing cool new features. I don&#8217;t relish the idea of writing new code to parse another format.</p>

<p>But&#8212;my philosophy is that NetNewsWire should work with what&#8217;s out there. It works with RSS 0.9x, RSS 1.0, and RSS 2.0 currently. If there&#8217;s a new format, and people use it and like it, I&#8217;ll support it. In other words, if this format is generated by one or more of the popular weblog publishing tools, then support in NetNewsWire is pretty much a given.</p>

<p>This effort seems to me to be more about fixing political bugs, real or perceived (same thing, maybe), than fixing problems in RSS itself. I could be wrong, since I haven&#8217;t had any time to look at the specifics.</p>

<p>About RSS and its political issues I have nothing to say. I&#8217;m Switzerland on this stuff. My philosophy is just to support what people use.</p>

<p>Anyway... about the technical merits of the new format, I&#8217;d like to take a look and provide feedback, but I won&#8217;t be able to until the weekend.
