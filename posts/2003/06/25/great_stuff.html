As a developer, the things at WWDC that I dig are things that make me more productive and that make my software better. Though I think iChat A/V and new G5s are cool and all, what gets me excited are the new developer tools, OS improvements, and the new stuff in Cocoa.</p>

<p>It turns out that there&#8217;s lots more than just WebKit to be glad about. And I&#8217;m just, well, amazed.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have a lot of time to write about it all, and a bunch is covered by nda anyway for now. But the upshot is that being a Mac developer is getting more and more fun.</p>

<p>But did I mention that the wireless connection is a bit overloaded? Nuts!
