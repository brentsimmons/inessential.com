I&#8217;m having a great time at WWDC!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s about 1:30 Pacific as I write this, and the first session on WebKit starts in a half-hour. Cool. There has been a little talk about it in some other sessions, including one where they showed how easy you could create a basic web browser. So, without knowing more yet, it sounds like they did a good job and it&#8217;s easy to embed in Cocoa apps.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I&#8217;m having some net connection issues, so I&#8217;m way behind on email. I&#8217;ll catch up on the weekend.
