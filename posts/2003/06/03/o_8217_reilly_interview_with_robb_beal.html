In the second of O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/developer/2003/06/03/innovators.html">Innovator Insight</a> interviews, Robb Beal is asked the same questions I was asked in the first <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/developer/2003/05/22/innovators.html">interview</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting (at least to me) to compare our different answers. Our interviews reflect different personalities and different visions&#8212;and I think our apps do too.</p>

<p>NetNewsWire is very textual. It takes a new thing (RSS) and puts it into a familiar interface.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.usercreations.com/spring/">Spring</a>, on the other hand, is very graphical. It takes familiar things and puts them into a new interface. With Spring, the new interface is the thing.</p>

<p>Despite our different visions, Robb and I definitely agree that independent developers benefit when they work together.</p>

<p>Another thing we&#8217;d agree on (I think) is that the web browser is not going to go away&#8212;and it should not go away, and we don&#8217;t want it to go away&#8212;but other applications are going to present other ways of doing things on the web.</p>

<p>The web is too big and cool to be stuffed entirely in the browser box. Yet browsers remain hugely important. It&#8217;s an AND thing, not an OR thing.
