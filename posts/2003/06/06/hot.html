They say it&#8217;s going to get into the <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/weather/">90s</a> here in Seattle today. Right on.</p>

<p>Also hot: the Mariners. They <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/134918247_mari06.html">swept the Phillies</a>. They now have a nine-game winning streak, all on the road.</p>

<p>The Phillies were my boyhood team.
