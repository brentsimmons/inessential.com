On the anniversary of D-Day, I thought I&#8217;d quote the famous Thomas Jefferson line: &#8220;Every man has two countries, his own and France.&#8221;</p>

<p>Except now I&#8217;m not sure it was Thomas Jefferson who said that. I did a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22every+man+has+two+countries%22">Google search</a>, and this line has been attributed also to Benjamin Franklin, John F. Kennedy, Voltaire, Henri de Bornier, and a <a href="http://www.brownhen.com/2003_03_30_backhen.html">station wagon</a>.
