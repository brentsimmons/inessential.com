<a href="http://ranchero.com/images/combinedview1.jpg"><img src="http://ranchero.com/images/combinedview1thumb.jpg" alt="Combined View screenshot detail" height="92" width="134" border="0" align="right" hspace="4" /></a>I&#8217;ve posted an introduction to NetNewsWire&#8217;s <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/features/combinedview.php">new Combined View</a>.</p>

<p>The new view combines titles and descriptions&#8212;it&#8217;s sort of like a web page, actually, except that you can navigate via arrow keys and the space bar and you can expand and collapse descriptions.</p>

<p>And you can get it from the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php">beta</a> page.</p>

<p>There are some other changes in this beta, mostly bug fixes, but also some new features&#8212;such as the ability to read feeds via https. Read the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire103.php">change notes</a> for more details.</p>
<h4>Hat tips</h4>
<p>The Combined View wouldn&#8217;t exist without the work and ideas of other people. <a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio UserLand</a> and other browser-based aggregators display news in a similar fashion, with titles and descriptions together.</p>

<p>Jason Kottke <a href="http://www.kottke.org/02/08/020823possible_net.html">suggested</a> this feature for NetNewsWire, and even did a quick <a href="http://www.kottke.org/plus/misc/images/netnewswire.gif">mock-up</a> of how it might look. (For comparison, here&#8217;s how Jason&#8217;s feed <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/kottkeview.jpg">actually looks</a>.)</p>

<p>And lots of other people have asked for this feature and kept asking for itâ€”and so we did it.</p>

<p>Finally, some brave souls helped test the alpha versions. The early versions of the Combined View were weird at first, but it got better, thanks to the testers.
