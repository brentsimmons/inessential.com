Today is the last day of the <a href="https://order.kagi.com/cgi-bin/store.cgi?storeID=2DQ">NetNewsWire $29.95 sale</a>. If you were thinking of buying NetNewsWire, I&#8217;d hate to have you miss out.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s coming up for NetNewsWire...</p>

<p>The next release will use Web Kit (the Safari renderer) to display HTML. This will be a big improvement on the current lame HTML renderer NetNewsWire uses.</p>

<p>It will probably also switch to the new URL downloading code that Safari uses.</p>

<p>And of course a bunch of bugs will be fixed.</p>

<p>After that release, the biggest item on the to-do list is synching. My hope is that synching will work not just between copies of NetNewsWire but between NetNewsWire and other aggregators.</p>

<p>I updated the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/featureIdeas.php">NetNewsWire Feature Ideas</a> page, which lists most of the ideas we&#8217;re strongly considering for the future. I added a section at the bottom listing things that have been done since the page was started, so we can have a visible track record.</p>

<p>(And if you have feature requests not listed there, feel free to leave a comment here or email me or post on the <a href="http://ranchero.com/bugs/add.php">bug tracker</a>.)<h4>What about Panther?</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve gotten a bunch of email about NetNewsWire and Panther. The only bug I know of specifically is a bug in the networking code in the current Panther seed that can cause NetNewsWire to crash. There may be other bugs, of course.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the deal: NetNewsWire will run on the final version of Panther. It will probably run on earlier versions of Panther too. But it&#8217;s impossible to say when.</p>

<p>I intend to take advantage of new technology in Panther, and have that ready in NetNewsWire before Panther ships. (A non-disclosure agreement prevents me from elaborating yet.)</p>

<p>However, I can&#8217;t guarantee that NetNewsWire will run trouble-free on the current Panther seed. Maybe yes, maybe no. It&#8217;s not a good use of my time to make sure it runs on an OS release that&#8217;s at such an early stage of development. Especially since the Panther bugs are, well, bugs in Panther.
