Dave Winer writes about <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$2070">prior art as a design method</a>: &#8220;Anyone who has worked with me knows how much I value prior art.&#8221;</p>

<p>True! As a UserLand employee I was often looking at prior art.</p>

<p><img src="http://ranchero.com/images/manilamembersjoin.jpg" height="76" width="72" alt="Manila members join box" align="right" />An example (one of many possible) is the standard Members box on Manila sites. We wanted a way to give people three links: join a site, login to a site, or logout if they&#8217;re logged in. So we looked around at a bunch of popular sites that had membership to see how they were doing it.</p>

<p><img src="http://ranchero.com/images/manilamemberssignout.jpg" height="51" width="71" alt="Manila members signout box" align="right" />There was a common thread: lots of sites used a little box with two states. When a user isn&#8217;t a member or isn&#8217;t logged in, it has two links: join and login. When a user is a logged-in member it has just one link to logout.</p>

<p>There was no clear consensus on terminology, so we chose what we thought was best. (There&#8217;s even a little inconsistency&#8212;there&#8217;s a Login link, but instead of a Logout link it&#8217;s a Sign Out link. This was not a problem.)</p>

<p>The thing is, we didn&#8217;t have to re-invent the wheel. We took a look and discovered that the wheel is round, and also that it doesn&#8217;t matter what color you paint it, it still rolls.</p>

<p>Anyway... I bring this up because I was planning to write about this topic today, and it&#8217;s coincidence that Dave also wrote about it.</p><h4>The pressures of conformity?</h4><p>What brings this up for me was that I was emailing with a guy who runs a couple cool websites, but his background is not software development. He added a new feature to his site, but he did it in a way that&#8217;s very different from how other sites do the same (or very similar) thing.</p>

<p>I suggested he do it the same way as sites x, y, and z. His response&#8212;light-hearted though it was&#8212;surprised me: he agreed to &#8220;conform.&#8221; (As in the negative social sense rather than the neutral engineering sense.)</p>

<p>What? <em>Conform</em>? That response surprised me.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s my advice to people building websites (or other software): look at prior art. Doing something the same way other sites or other software do it is a good thing. It&#8217;s not some kind of evil conformity.</p>

<p>There is still plenty of room for innovation and self-expression. In fact, looking at prior art allows you to quickly solve the problems that have already been solved&#8212;so you can concentrate on the new problems, the problems that are yours to solve, the stuff that makes your software cool.</p>

<p>Prior art is your friend.
