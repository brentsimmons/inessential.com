I was reading this totally funny thing, a <a href="http://thelemon.net/issues/timeline.php">History of the Internet</a>, and it mentions weblogs as being invented in 2001.</p>

<p>At first I didn&#8217;t think about that, but then I did, and I realized&#8212;for all the talk about weblogs these days, weblogs are actually very old.</p>

<p>In fact&#8212;I did some quick checking, and I think weblogs were invented <em>ten years and four days</em> ago. Check out the June 14, 1993 date at the bottom of the archive for <a href="http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/old-whats-new/whats-new-0693.html">What&#8217;s New with NCSA Mosaic</a>.</p>

<p>Happy tenth birthday to weblogs!</p>

<p>More modern weblogs date back to 1997. For instance, here are the first posts for <a href="http://scriptingnewsarchive.userland.com/1997/04/01">Scripting News</a> and <a href="http://www.camworld.com/archives/1997/06/index.html#000009">CamWorld</a>.</p>

<p>The first weblog authoring software that I know of is <a href="http://www.scripting.com/frontier/netScripting/newsPage.html">NewsPage</a>, from May 1997.
