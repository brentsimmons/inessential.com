The next version of NetNewsWire will include support for updated items.</p>

<p>The idea is this: when a headline comes in&#8212;and it&#8217;s not new but edited&#8212;it doesn&#8217;t get marked as unread. Instead it&#8217;s marked as updated.</p>

<p>This is a good thing because it means that you don&#8217;t re-read a headline for each little edit.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the thing, though: it works only for...</p>

<p>1. RSS 2.0 feeds that contain guids.</p>

<p>2. RSS 1.0 feeds. (It uses the rdf:about attribute as an identifier.)</p>

<p>That means it works for many RSS feeds but not all of them.</p>

<p>So... if your feeds are RSS 0.9x feeds, please upgrade them!</p>

<p>If your feeds are RSS 2.0 feeds, but they don&#8217;t contain guids, please add guids!</p>

<p>It will make people who read your feeds happier.
