I&#8217;ve been making progress on the smash view for NetNewsWire&#8212;the view that puts headlines and descriptions together. There are tons more bugs to fix, but here&#8217;s a <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/smashViewProgress.jpg">screen shot</a> of what it looks like so far. (It will get better, of course.)</p>

<p>You can flip back-and-forth between the smash view and the traditional view by choosing a command in the View menu. I&#8217;ll probably give it a keyboard shortcut.</p>

<p>After posting that long list of <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/featureIdeas.php">feature ideas</a> on Wednesday, I got lots of feedback on what new features people want to see next, and this was at or near the top of just about everybody&#8217;s list. So the plan for NetNewsWire 1.0.3 (full version) is to add this feature and also fix a bunch of bugs.
