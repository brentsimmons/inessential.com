I get email and comments here about how people would like the Sites Drawer to be dynamic.</p>

<p>People usually suggest one or both of two things:</p>

<p>1. The Sites Drawer should be an OPML or RSS file hosted on my site that the app could read.</p>

<p>2. People should be able to replace or add to the Sites Drawer with other OPML or RSS files that list subscriptions.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s #2 that&#8217;s interesting to me. I won&#8217;t do just #1 because of two main drawbacks: every network operation is prone to failure, and it&#8217;s a big list&#8212;it would chew up bandwidth without a really compelling reason.</p>

<p>I like the idea of being able to import OPML subscription lists into the Sites Drawer. Some people might maintain lists that are comprehensive for certain categories&#8212;say you have a list of all the weblogs by people in Chicago. The idea is it would be possible for NetNewsWire users to add a Chicago category to their Sites Drawer by downloading your list.</p>

<p>The challenge, as is almost always true, is the user interface. NetNewsWire can download and parse and store OPML files, no problem.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll do this for 1.0.3. But it&#8217;s on the to-do list.
