People don&#8217;t always realize that it can be pretty easy to subscribe to a site in NetNewsWire. So I did a couple movies.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ranchero.com/downloads/nnwDragSubscribe.mov">first movie</a> shows how to subscribe via drag-and-drop, by dragging one of those little orange XML buttons.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ranchero.com/downloads/nnwServicesSubscribe.mov">second movie</a> shows how to subscribe by using the Services menu.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never made screen capture movies before, so please be kind: they&#8217;re a little jerky. I&#8217;m still figuring out the best settings. (I used Snapz Pro, by the way.)
