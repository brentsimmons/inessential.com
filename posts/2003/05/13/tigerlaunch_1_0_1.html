<p>The app remains open source (BSD license); the source code is available from the TigerLaunch page.</p>

<p>For the curious: the app was building the Apps menu during awakeFromNib, but that was the wrong time to do it, since it was relying on another class&#8217;s awakeFromNib having already been called, which wasn&#8217;t always the case.</p>

<p>So I added an applicationDidFinishLaunching delegate method, and now the menus get built then. This fixed the bug.
