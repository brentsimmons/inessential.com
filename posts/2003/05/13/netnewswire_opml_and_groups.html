A question people often ask is: why isn&#8217;t NetNewsWire&#8217;s groups structure reflected in the OPML it generates when you choose Export Subscriptions?</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s why:</p>

<p>The OPML file containing the exported subscriptions list is designed to be compatible with other news readers such as Radio UserLand and AmphetaDesk.</p>

<p>Not all news readers have a groups feature. Were groups included in the OPML, at least some other news readers wouldn&#8217;t be able to import the subscriptions.</p>

<p>What people want, I think, is a synch feature, a way to synchronize two copies of NetNewsWire. Makes sense&#8212;I want that too. That&#8217;s a separate feature, though. And it&#8217;s more complex than just exporting the subscriptions: you need to export the read/unread status of the headlines in those subscriptions, too.
