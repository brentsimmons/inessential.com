I just added expand and collapse to NetNewsWire&#8217;s upcoming Combined View feature. Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/combinedviewexpandcollapse.jpg">screen shot</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s one of those features where a bunch of people asked for it, but I didn&#8217;t think it was important&#8212;so I added it anyway, and now I totally love it.</p>

<p>(To be utterly clear: you&#8217;re able to expand and collapse the descriptions. Being able to expand and collapse trackbacks and comments is a whole different issue, and I&#8217;m not working on that for the 1.0.3 release.)
