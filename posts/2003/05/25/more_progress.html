I&#8217;ve renamed NetNewsWire&#8217;s Smash View feature to the Combined View. (Smash View was just a temporary name.)</p>

<p>So far I&#8217;m on track for a beta some time this coming week.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a new <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/combinedview1.jpg">screen shot</a>.</p>

<p>In the screen shot you can see a few changes since the last screen shot:</p>

<p>The look of it is a bit less flat, more Aqua-like.</p>

<p>The selected item&#8212;including the description&#8212;is highlighted using the system highlight settings. (In other words, the yellow is my system setting, not a hard-coded color.)</p>

<p>There&#8217;s an unread item at the bottom-right, and it gets a little circle signifying that it&#8217;s unread. (Just using bold and colored text wasn&#8217;t enough.)</p>

<p>Just for jazz, here&#8217;s another <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/kottkecombinedview.jpg">screen shot</a>, this time of Jason Kottke&#8217;s weblog. Compare it to his original <a href="http://www.kottke.org/plus/misc/images/netnewswire.gif">mock-up</a> of this feature.
