For the next release of NetNewsWire, I&#8217;m adding the ability to read RSS feeds that are available via SSL (via https URLs).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m dealing only with SSL servers that have valid, unexpired certificates, at least for this release.</p>

<p>The problem is, I&#8217;ve so far found only one such https RSS feed. It worked just fine, but I&#8217;d like to test with some more.</p>

<p>So if you know of any, please email me the URL or URLs. (Or post them in a comment.) Thanks!
