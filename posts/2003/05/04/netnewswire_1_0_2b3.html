<a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php">NetNewsWire 1.0.2b3</a> fixes some bugs and updates the Sites Drawer.</p>

<p>Also, the Sites Drawer has a new feature, a Latest Additions folder. The idea is to make it easy to see what&#8217;s new, and to help you find sites you may not have known about. There are some pretty cool sites in there&#8212;Davos Newbies, Gary Hart, Jeffrey Zeldman, Karelia Software, MobileTracker, Release 4.0, and lots more. </p>

<p>See the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire102.php">change notes</a> for more details on this release.
