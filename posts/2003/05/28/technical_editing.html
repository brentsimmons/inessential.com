On the side, when I&#8217;m not working on NetNewsWire, I&#8217;ve been doing technical editing for Rogers Cadenhead&#8217;s upcoming book <a href="http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/kickstart/index.html">Radio UserLand Kick Start</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been kind of fun, because I&#8217;m reminded of things I know so well but haven&#8217;t worked with so much lately. And also I&#8217;ve been learning about some of the things added to Radio after my time at UserLand.</p>

<p>One of the things that I ran across today&#8212;and that almost made me laugh, but in a good way, because it&#8217;s cool&#8212;is system.verbs.apps.Google.</p>

<p>When I started using Frontier (back in the days of dinosaurs) the system.verbs.apps table contained glue for scripting applications like Eudora, the Finder, BBEdit, Filemaker Pro, and so on. Now it contains glue for web services apps&#8212;and I like that, it makes sense to me.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to my reading...
