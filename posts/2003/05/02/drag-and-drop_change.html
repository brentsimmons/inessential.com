I just made a change in NetNewsWire that will appear in the next beta: if you drag a URL onto the Subscriptions pane, then that annoying dialog that used to appear doesn&#8217;t appear anymore. It just does it, it just subscribes to that URL.</p>

<p>This makes it easier to subscribe to sites you find on the Web. For instance (at least with Safari and Camino), you can actually drag-and-drop the orange XML buttons onto the Subscriptions pane.</p>

<p>Until the next beta appears, you&#8217;ll still get an annoying dialog box, but that will change.</p>

<p>P.S. Lots of people have asked that you be able to drag-and-drop a URL onto the Dock icon. I wish I could do that. Unfortunately, the Dock has no facility for accepting drops that aren&#8217;t files. So I can&#8217;t make that feature happen. Maybe in the future some day.
