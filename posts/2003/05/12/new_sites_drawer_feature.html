NetNewsWire 1.0.2 has a new feature in the Sites Drawer: a Latest Additions group. It lists the sites added to the Sites Drawer since the previous release. Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/latestAdditions.jpg">screen shot</a>.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t an earth-shattering new feature&#8212;but it does make it easier to find cool sites you may not know about. And that&#8217;s something I want to make even easier in the future.
