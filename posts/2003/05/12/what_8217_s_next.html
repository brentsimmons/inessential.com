Now that NetNewsWire 1.0.2 has shipped, what&#8217;s next?</p>

<p>First there&#8217;s a bug in TigerLaunch I want to fix.</p>

<p>Then it&#8217;s time to do a new version of NetNewsWire Lite. There are lots of bug fixes in the full version that will appear in the next Lite version.</p>

<p>Then it&#8217;s on to NetNewsWire 1.0.3.</p>

<p>What will go into NetNewsWire 1.0.3? More bug fixes. Some new features: I haven&#8217;t decided which, yet. If you have an opinion, I&#8217;d love to hear it.
