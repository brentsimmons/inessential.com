<a href="http://www.tow.com/software/read_it_to_me/">Read it to Me</a> &#8220;creates a playlist of MP3 files in iTunes from your unread items in                 NetNewsWire using Apple&#8217;s Text-to-Speech that you can sync to your iPod.&#8221;</p>

<p>This means you can listen to your NetNewsWire news in your iPod.</p>

<p>One of the things I like about this&#8212;other than its coolness&#8212;is that it gives me a good excuse to mention NetNewsWire&#8217;s scriptability.</p>

<p>I get email from people sometimes who they say they&#8217;re using NetNewsWire Lite instead of the full version because they either don&#8217;t have a weblog or they&#8217;re editing it some other way.</p>

<p>But weblog editing is not the only feature that separates the full version from the Lite version.</p>

<p>Another of the differences is scriptability. The full version of NetNewsWire is not only scriptable, it also includes a Scripts menu where you can add your own commands just by dropping a script into a folder. (You&#8217;ve probably seen this same feature in BBEdit, Eudora, and so on.)</p>

<p>Scriptability is important because it makes things like Read it to Me possible. I would never have thought of adding a feature where you can listen to your news on your iPod.</p>

<p>But someone else could think of it&#8212;and do it&#8212;because NetNewsWire is scriptable. </p>

<p>And I&#8217;m sure there are other good ideas too, ideas that I myself would never think of. That&#8217;s the beauty of scripting.
