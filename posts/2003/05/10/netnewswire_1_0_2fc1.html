<a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php">NetNewsWire 1.0.2fc1</a> updates the Help book to match changes in 1.0.2. It also adds a few more sites to the Sites Drawer.</p>

<p>Otherwise there are no code changes since the previous beta.</p>

<p>The question now is&#8212;are there any deal-stopper bugs? Or can 1.0.2fc1 be re-built with just a version change to make it 1.0.2?
