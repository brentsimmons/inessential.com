One of the prizes for winning the O&#8217;Reilly contest was a free registration to this year&#8217;s <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m totally looking forward to it, of course. I&#8217;ve never been before.</p>

<p>Aside from meeting other developers, the thing I&#8217;m looking forward to the most is session #424, <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/descriptions.html#424">Advanced WebKit APIs</a>.</p>

<p>From the description: &#8220;Go in-depth on how to embed Safari HTML rendering capabilities within your Mac OS X application and customize its behavior. Details will be provided on how to change locations, manage contextual menus, show progress indication, and take advantage of history and page caching.&#8221;</p>

<p>NetNewsWire needs WebKit.
