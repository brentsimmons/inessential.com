<a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php">NetNewsWire 1.0.2b10</a> fixes a few weblog editor bugs&#8212;particularly bugs with editing Blosxom sites.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire102.php">change notes</a> for the full scoop.</p>

<p>This should be the last beta to include any code changes. Unless deal-stopper bugs are found, the next release will include updates to the Sites Drawer and updated documentation, but no more code changes. It will be a final candidate release.</p>

<p>The plan is to release NetNewsWire 1.0.2 on Monday, though of course it could slip to later in the week.
