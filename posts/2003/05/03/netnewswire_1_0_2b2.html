<a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php">NetNewsWire 1.0.2b2</a> fixes a small handful of bugs; see the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire102.php">change notes</a> for details.</p>

<p>One of the bugs it fixes, at least partly, is the notorious jumpy-cursor bug that happens when the current feed is getting updated. More testing is required to see if it&#8217;s totally fixed or just made a little bit better.
