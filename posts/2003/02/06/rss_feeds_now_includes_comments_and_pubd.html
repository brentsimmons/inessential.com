The RSS feeds for <a href="http://ranchero.com/xml/rss.xml">ranchero.com</a> and <a href="http://inessential.com/xml/rss.xml">inessential.com</a> now include comments links and pubDates, which should show up in NetNewsWire and other news readers that support these elements.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m thinking of doing a parameterized RSS feed for the bug tracker next. It should be easier to keep track of bugs, both for me and for people who report bugs.
