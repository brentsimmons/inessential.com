Among the changes in <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/probeta/">NetNewsWire 1.0b15</a> is a new feature: if you ctrl-click (or right-click) on a headline, there&#8217;s a new Open Comments in Browser command.</p>

<p><a href="http://backend.userland.com/rss">RSS 2.0</a> feeds sometimes include a comments element, which contains the URL of the page for comments on a given headline. Most feeds in my subscription list don&#8217;t include this&#8212;at least not yet&#8212;but for the ones that do it&#8217;s a pretty nice feature. (I think so, at least.)</p>

<p>I hope that more feeds will include comments URLs in the future.</p>

<p>Yes, I will update my own RSS feeds to include comments URLs. (And dates too.)
