For the upcoming NetNewsWire Pro release I made a change to the default list of 15 subscriptions that new users get: I added Dave Hyatt&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/">Surfin&#8217; Safari</a> weblog.</p>

<p>My hope is that new users will see that there&#8217;s a weblog by one of the Safari developers, and they&#8217;ll think that&#8217;s pretty cool, and they&#8217;ll wonder if other developers of their favorite software have weblogs.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a great thing&#8212;at least I think so&#8212;when developers have a human presence on the web. I myself am a developer&#8212;but I&#8217;m also a user of software, just like everybody else.</p>

<p>(Of course every developer is also a user of other software.)</p>

<p>So my hope is they&#8217;ll find weblogs like <a href="http://stevenf.com/mt/">~stevenf</a>, the weblog of Panic developer Steven Frank. And weblogs like <a href="http://www.truerwords.net/index">Truer Words</a>, <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>, <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/log/">Six Log</a>, <a href="http://www.usercreations.com/weblog/">Robb Beal&#8217;s weblog</a>, and so on and so on.
