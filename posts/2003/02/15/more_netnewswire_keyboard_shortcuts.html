More NetNewsWire keyboard shortcuts...</p>

<p>You can expand and collapse in the subscriptions and Sites Drawer panes with these keys:</p>

<p>Expand: .<br />
Collapse: ,<br />
Expand all: &#039;<br />
Collapse all: ;</p>

<p>No cmd-key-modifiers, just the plain keys.</p>

<p>Another thing is arrow-key navigation:</p>

<p>You can go from the subscriptions to the headlines pane using the right-arrow. If no headlines are selected, the first headline will be selected.</p>

<p>When the headlines pane has focus, the right-arrow key opens the current headline in the browser. It&#8217;s the same as double-clicking on the headline or typing cmd-B.</p>

<p>When the headlines pane has focus, the left-arrow key goes back to the subscriptions pane.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s how I personally do my navigation: I use arrow keys and the space bar (for going to the next unread).
