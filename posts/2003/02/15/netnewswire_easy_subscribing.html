Another of my favorite NetNewsWire features is how you can subscribe using the Services menu.</p>

<p>With any app&#8212;Safari, Chimera, etc.&#8212;that supports Services, all you have to do is:</p>

<p>1. Select a URL. (As in the address field in Safari.)</p>

<p>2. Choose Subscribe in NetNewsWire from the Services menu.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/nnwServices.jpg">screen shot</a> to show what I mean.
