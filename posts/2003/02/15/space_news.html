One of my favorite RSS feeds is spacetoday.net: &#8220;Space news summaries and links to articles published around the web.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.spacetoday.net/summaries.rdf">feed</a> and here&#8217;s their <a href="http://www.spacetoday.net/">home page</a>.</p>

<p>It not only reports on the Columbia investigations but also other things&#8212;that the southern Martian polar cap is made of water ice, that the latest Ariane launch was a success, that kind of thing.
