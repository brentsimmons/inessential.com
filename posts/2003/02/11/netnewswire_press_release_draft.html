One of the things about releasing software is you have to write a press release. Nuts!</p>

<p>Well, maybe you don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to write a press release, but it&#8217;s probably a good idea, at least for major milestones.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m no MBA or marketing type, so I sure wouldn&#8217;t mind a little help. I&#8217;ve posted a <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/pr/NetNewsWire1.php">draft here</a>, and I&#8217;d appreciate feedback, either as comments on this site or via email to brent at ranchero dot com. Thanks!
