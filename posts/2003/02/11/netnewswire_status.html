The reports for NetNewsWire 1.0fc1 have been good, so I&#8217;m giving it until noon Pacific, and if no deal-stoppers have been reported I&#8217;m going to change the version to 1.0 and ship it.</p>

<p>The e-commerce thing is set up and working and tested. There&#8217;s a new home page for NetNewsWire sitting on my hard drive. All that remains is to package up the app and upload it and let folks know it&#8217;s up.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll write a press release too, but that can come later today or tomorrow.</p>

<p>The worst problem in NetNewsWire remains Apple&#8217;s crashy XML-RPC framework. I&#8217;ve spent untold hours developing work-arounds. And still it may crash. So the top priority for 1.0.1 will probably be my writing my own XML-RPC code. (I may do a Cocoa wrapper for <a href="http://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/">Eric Kidd&#8217;s code</a>. Naturally I&#8217;d release my code under a BSD-type license.)</p>

<p>And of course there are plenty of other things to do. There always are. It&#8217;s times like this when I try very, very hard not to think of the classic DaveNet <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware">We Make Shitty Software</a>. (With bugs!)</p>

<p>(Update: why do I try <em>not</em> to think of that DaveNet? I&#8217;m just trying to be funny. Really I don&#8217;t mind thinking of it.)
