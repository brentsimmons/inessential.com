I remember back in the day&#8212;1996 or thereabouts&#8212;when Frontier&#8217;s HTML framework was new, it seemed to lots of people that the idea of using templates to build websites was an idea from outer space.</p>

<p>(Frontier wasn&#8217;t the only system to use templates, I&#8217;m sure, it just happens to be the one I used and later worked on.)</p>

<p>The attitude of lots of people I talked to was that multi-file search-and-replace was all they&#8217;d ever need.</p>

<p>I think weblogging changed that. There are now lots&#8212;hundreds of thousands? I don&#8217;t know&#8212;of people who have some experience using templates to publish on the web (whether they&#8217;re using UserLand software or Blogger or Movable Type or whatever). They still might not be using templates for their entire sites, but at least it&#8217;s no longer a completely alien idea.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is just an observation. I think it&#8217;s cool.
