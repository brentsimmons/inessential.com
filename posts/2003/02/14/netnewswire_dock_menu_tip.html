If you click-and-hold, ctrl-click, or right-click (if you have a two-button mouse) on NetNewsWire&#8217;s icon in the Dock, the menu displays unread messages.</p>

<p>You probably knew that already.</p>

<p>But&#8212;you may not have known that if you hold down the option key, then, instead of opening the headline in the browser, you go to that headline in NetNewsWire.
