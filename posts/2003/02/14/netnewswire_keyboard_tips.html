Here are a few more keyboard shortcuts for NetNewsWire that aren&#8217;t obvious:</p>

<p>When the headlines pane in the news reader has focus, you can...</p>

<p>1. Type U to mark a headline as unread.</p>

<p>2. Type R to mark a headline as read.</p>

<p>3. Type M to mark a headline as unread and go to the next unread headline.</p>

<p>In the weblog editor, the buttons for Bold, Italic, and Add Link have keystrokes...</p>

<p>1. Cmd-B encloses the selection with &lt;strong&gt; tags.</p>

<p>2. Cmd-I encloses the selection with &lt;em&gt; tags.</p>

<p>3. Option-Cmd-A allows you to enclose the selection with link tags. (I wanted this to be Ctrl-Cmd-A, as in BBEdit, but Interface Builder wouldn&#8217;t let me do that. I still plan to make this button respond to Ctrl-Cmd-A in the future.)
