<strong>Shower dementia:</strong> When you&#8217;re taking a shower and can&#8217;t remember if you&#8217;ve washed your hair yet.</p>

<p><strong>Shampoo vu:</strong> That strange feeling you sometimes get that you&#8217;re washing your hair for the fourth time in the same shower. (A consequence usually of shower dementia.)
