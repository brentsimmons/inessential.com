The Portuguese-language MacMagazine.com.br has published an <a href="http://www.macmagazine.com.br/artigos/more.php?id=32_0_1_0">interview with me</a>.</p>

<p>(The interview was conducted in English and translated to Portuguese by the MacMagazine staff.)</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the AltaVista <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/urltrurl?lp=pt_en&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.macmagazine.com.br%2Fartigos%2Fmore.php%3Fid%3D32_0_1_0">translation back into English</a>. I love BabelFish translations: they usually have an &#8220;all your base...&#8221; kind of feel to them. A few quotes:</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel myself excellent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For me, the great fact was not accurately the Safari, but its engine of renderiza&#231;&#227;o that will be available for the desenvolvedores.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this can move, is clearly.&#8221;
