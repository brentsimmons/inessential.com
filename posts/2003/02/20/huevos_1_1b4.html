Huevos 1.1b4 (<a href="http://ranchero.com/downloads/Huevos1.1b4.sit">download</a>)  includes several changes:</p>

<p>- Main window is no longer metallic.<br />
- Added a File menu with two commands: New and Close. New command opens the main search window. Close command closes the front window.<br />
- If the main window is closed, clicking on the Dock icon will open it.<br />
- If the main window is closed, typing the Huevos hotkey combination will open it.<br />
- The Escape key cancels a search engine configuration sheet.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a good chance that there will be few or no changes between this version and the final 1.1 version.
