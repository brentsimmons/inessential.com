<p><a href="http://ranchero.com/huevos/">Huevos 1.1</a> has been released!</p>

<p>The big change since 1.0 is that you don&#8217;t have to lift your fingers from the keyboard anymore. You can bring Huevos to the front from within any app by typing a hotkey. You can choose search engines in the popup menu by typing a command key or by using the up and down arrow keys.</p>

<p>This release also marks the first time we&#8217;ve had a PayPal donation button. We&#8217;ll add a button to our other software pages, too, of course.</p>

<p>Donations help us continue to make free software. Not just Huevos but also TigerLaunch, Big Cat, and NetNewsWire Lite.</p>

<p>And it helps us to be able to release parts of NetNewsWire as open source, such as the <a href="http://ranchero.com/cocoa/rss/">RSS</a> and <a href="http://ranchero.com/cocoa/opml/">OPML</a> parsers and&#8212;coming soon&#8212;a Cocoa XML-RPC implementation.
