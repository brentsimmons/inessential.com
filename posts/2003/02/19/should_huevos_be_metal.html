Should Huevos&#8217; main search window be metallic?</p>

<p>There has been a ton of confusion over when metal is cool to use. Clearly the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/Essentials/AquaHIGuidelines/AHIGWindows/chapter_5_section_4.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961/CHDHHBGJ">Human Interface Guidelines</a> are largely ignored&#8212;especially by Apple. (Why is Safari metal?)</p>

<p>The docs state: &#8220;Avoid using the textured window appearance in applications or utilities that are unrelated to digital peripherals or to the data associated with these devices.&#8221;</p>

<p>This states unequivocally that Huevos (and Safari and some other apps) should definitely <em>not</em> use metal windows.
