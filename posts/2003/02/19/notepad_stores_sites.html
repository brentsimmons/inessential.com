One of the common questions I get asked about NetNewsWire is: How can I store an RSS feed that I don&#8217;t want to read for now, but that I don&#8217;t want to lose?</p>

<p>I may add a way to do this in the future&#8212;perhaps when I do feed-specific refresh settings.</p>

<p>But for now you can use the Notepad. You can drag feeds from the Subscriptions pane to the Notepad to store them.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/sitesInNotepad.jpg">screen shot</a> of part of my Notepad. When I get a request to add a site to the Sites Drawer, I store the feed in my Notepad. (I subscribe to some of them, too&#8212;I learn about lots of cool sites this way.)</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the same <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/sitesInNotepadAndInfo.jpg">screen shot</a> with the Notepad Info window open.</p>

<p>(You can also store RSS headlines, file references, and URLs in the Notepad. Just drag and drop.)
