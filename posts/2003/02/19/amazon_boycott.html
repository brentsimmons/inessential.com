Are we still <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/ask_tim/amazon_patent.html">boycotting Amazon</a> for their patent practices?</p>

<p>I get requests to add Amazon as a default search engine for Huevos, but I haven&#8217;t so far because I&#8217;m still, well, angry at Amazon.</p>

<p>I wonder if it&#8217;s not time to relent. After all, Amazon isn&#8217;t the only offender when it comes to patents. And some time has passed. Is there a statute of limitations?
