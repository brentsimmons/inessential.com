Thanks for all the feedback on the press release for NetNewsWire. Here&#8217;s an <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/pr/NetNewsWire1.php">updated draft</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the feedback was about two things:</p>

<p>1. It should describe better what NetNewsWire is, what it does, and why that&#8217;s cool.</p>

<p>2. It should use active voice more often.</p>

<p>I think both things are better in the current draft. What do you think&#8212;is it ready to go?
