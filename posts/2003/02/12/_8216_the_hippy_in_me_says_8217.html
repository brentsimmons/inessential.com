I liked <a href="http://www.flexistentialist.org/archives/000218.shtml">this post</a>, made a few days ago at flexistentalist.org: &#8220;But the hippy in me says &#8216;What about open source? You need to give back to the development community!&#8217; Then I find that they do give back. Instead of making their entire applications open source, they have released numerous &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; applications that utilize the core functions of NetNewsWire, wrapped in a very simple application with an open source BSD license.&#8221;</p>

<p>My thinking is that every developer owes a lot to other developers. Developers are lucky that they get to be very generous&#8212;and they&#8217;re lucky these days that they have the Web, which makes generosity so easy.</p>

<p>So it&#8217;s kind of a karma thing, the hippie in me says. Pay back as much as you can. And there are tons of other developers who feel the same way.
