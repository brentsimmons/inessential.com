It looks like spammers are getting smart&#8212;the super spam filter that comes with Apple&#8217;s Mail app is starting to miss stuff. I&#8217;m seeing like 15 or so spams a day now, up from about two or three.</p>

<p>Nuts!</p>

<p>Doing a view-source on the spam shows that it&#8217;s HTML mail. It contains a bunch of do-nothing comments or tags that break up the words.</p>

<p>The fix is obvious, I think&#8212;the spam filters should filter on the visible words, rather than just the raw text.</p>

<p>I seriously hope there&#8217;s an update soon. I&#8217;ve been so spoiled and I don&#8217;t want to go back to a spam-ful world.
