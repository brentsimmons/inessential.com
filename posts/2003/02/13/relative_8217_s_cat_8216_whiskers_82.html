A relative of mine has a cat who needs a good home.</p>

<p>Whiskers is about three years old, a beautiful black cat who loves people, loves to play, and loves to be petted. She&#8217;s de-clawed, so she&#8217;s furniture-safe. She&#8217;s low maintenance and super-sweet and not going to wreck your couch.</p>

<p>The thing is, as much as she loves people, she&#8217;s afraid of other cats&#8212;and right now she&#8217;s living with two other cats, one of whom is very aggressive.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t already have a pet, and would maybe like Whiskers, please let me know! (Send email to brent at ranchero dot com.)</p>

<p>She comes bundled with her favorite toys, a cat box, and some food. A cat carrier too, I think.</p>

<p>Thanks!
