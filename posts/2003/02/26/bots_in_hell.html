I&#8217;ve been fascinated by Mark Pilgrim&#8217;s posts on banning bad robots and spambots and so on. </p>

<p>The latest&#8212;<a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/02/26/how_to_block_spambots_ban_spybots_and_tell_unwanted_robots_to_go_to_hell.html">How to block spambots, ban spybots, and tell unwanted robots to go to hell</a>&#8212;has me actually downloading my access log and checking for abusive bots.</p>

<p>(Once upon a time&#8212;like seven years ago or something&#8212;I wrote a WebSTAR plugin called DenyAgent which allowed people to block bots on their systems. So I&#8217;ve been interested in this topic before.)
