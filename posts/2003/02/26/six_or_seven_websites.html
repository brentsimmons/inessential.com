Does anybody else remember this?</p>

<p>In 1999 or so it seemed like all I heard was how before long there would just be six or seven websites. The biggest sites with the most money would remain, and all the other sites would disappear.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t believe it then. And it was right around the time of those predictions that weblogging software like Blogger and Manila appeared.</p>

<p>So this is just a reminder&#8212;when people predict total corporate domination for the web, they&#8217;ll probably be wrong.</p>

<p>They&#8217;d be right about pretty much anything else, but not the web.
