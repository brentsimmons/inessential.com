<p>There are just a few small <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire104.php">changes</a> since the previous beta: turned off underlined text when showing HTML differences, turned off tooltips for headlines in the Combined View, and updated the Help book.</p>

<p>This is a final candidate release, which means we&#8217;re looking for major bugs, bugs that have to be fixed before shipping 1.0.4.</p>

<p>(Note to Version Tracker, MacUpdate, and others: it&#8217;s cool to list this release if you want. Thanks for being considerate about the previous release.)
