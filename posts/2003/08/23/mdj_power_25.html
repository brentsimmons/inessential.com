I was totally flattered to have been on John Gruber&#8217;s <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2003/08/the_daring_fireball_power_1_list.html">ballot</a> for the <a href="http://www.macjournals.com/gcsf/mdj_power_25_2003.html">MDJ Power 25</a>.</p>

<p>Below is my ballot. (I didn&#8217;t vote for Steve Jobs, by the way. Of course he&#8217;s most powerful in the Mac community, but I felt like voting for people who I actually see when I look around.)</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s how I voted:</p>

<p>1. <a href="http://macintouch.com/">Ric Ford</a></p>

<p>MacInTouch is the center of the Macintosh web; it&#8217;s the &#8220;paper of record&#8221; for Mac news.</p>

<p>2. <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/54">Derrick Story</a></p>

<p>As O&#8217;Reilly Network managing editor, Derrick works on MacDevCenter, which has consistently published great articles for Mac developers. The Mac OS X Innovators contest rewards creativity in OS X development.</p>

<p>3. <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/">Dave Hyatt</a></p>

<p>Dave works on WebCore, the rendering code underneath Safari and Web Kit. His weblog is a great example of a developer developing in public.</p>

<p>4. <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/">Aaron Hillegass</a></p>

<p>Aaron&#8217;s Cocoa book, one of the first, taught lots of developers how to program in Cocoa. Big Nerd Ranch continues to teach developers.</p>

<p>5. <a href="http://weblog.karelia.com/">Dan Wood</a></p>

<p>Watson was one of the first OS X apps to show you can have a product that works with the web but isn&#8217;t a web browser&#8212;a powerful demonstration that richer interfaces are possible, and that people would like them.
