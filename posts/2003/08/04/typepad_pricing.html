I&#8217;ve seen a few people complain about <a href="http://www.typepad.com/news/2003/08/typepad_feature.html">TypePad pricing</a>. It ranges from $4.95 to $14.95 per month.</p>

<p>Listen: those prices are <em>low</em>.</p>

<p>One thing maybe not everyone realizes is that things on the Web have costs. Software costs money to develop and maintain. Servers have to be bought and administered; bandwidth has to be paid for; backups have to be made. Someone has to do the bookkeeping. Someone has to do customer support.</p>

<p>Running a service like TypePad is a long way away from doing some little fun thing for free. That it costs, even at the high end, under 15 bucks a month is utterly fantastic. To the Six Apart folks I say: good job.
