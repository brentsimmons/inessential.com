Note to proxy users...</p>

<p>I got a couple bug reports that NetNewsWire 1.0.4 doesn&#8217;t work with some proxies that 1.0.3 worked with.</p>

<p>I think I&#8217;ve fixed the bug, but it needs some testing&#8212;if you have a proxy server you can test with, I&#8217;d appreciate hearing if it works or not:</p>

<p><a href="http://ranchero.com/downloads/NetNewsWire1.0.4v2.tar.gz">Download NetNewsWire 1.0.4 proxy-fix build</a></p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t use a proxy, you can ignore this entirely.</p>

<p>PS My testing was with Apache running on the same machine as NetNewsWire. This new build worked fine&#8212;but then, it worked fine before, too. So I think the bug is when you have a proxy and your access to the outside is restricted (you can&#8217;t do DNS lookups, for instance).
