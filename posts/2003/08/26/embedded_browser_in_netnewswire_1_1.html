We&#8217;re starting to think about what new features will appear in NetNewsWire 1.1. There are lots of good ideas&#8212;some of which appear on the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/featureIdeas.php">feature ideas</a> page.</p>

<p>One of the things we&#8217;re thinking about is embedded browsing. The idea is pretty simple: click on a link in NetNewsWire, and the page opens right there rather than in your web browser.</p>

<p>It would be optional, of course, and probably turned off by default.</p>

<p>There has been a really excellent debate about this on the testing list. People mostly seem to be against it. Which is fine by me&#8212;I&#8217;d rather work on things like synching and persistence and so on than on this particular feature.</p>

<p>However, some people are in favor of this feature. And it may be that this is just one of the standard features of RSS newsreaders.</p><h4>Screen shots</h4><p>Check out the Windows newsreader named <a href="http://www31.brinkster.com/toolmaker/beaver.htm">Beaver</a>&#8212;click on the Main Window screen shot (in the left-side column). (It gives me a 403 if I link to it directly.)</p>

<p>And here&#8217;s a <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/embeddedbrowser1.png">screen shot</a> of a quick demo I did for NetNewsWire. Note that there would have to be some more UI (a back button and so on), but otherwise the screen shots are very similar.</p><h4>Should we do this feature?</h4><p>Beaver isn&#8217;t the only newsreader with this feature. A case can be made that it&#8217;s a checklist feature, that we pretty much have to do it.</p>

<p>But, aside from that, and more importantly&#8212;do you want this feature? If so, do you want it before synching, persistence, flagged news items, Atom support, more scriptability, Rendezvous, etc. etc.?</p>

<p>To help out the discussion a little bit, I did a special build that has embedded browsing. It doesn&#8217;t have the full UI needed, but if you click on a link it opens in place. (I used this build to make the screen shot above.) This is <em>not</em> meant for everyday use, but if you&#8217;d like to try it, you can <a href="http://ranchero.com/downloads/NetNewsWire1.1d1.tar.gz">download</a> NetNewsWire 1.1d1. This is for thrill-seekers only, it&#8217;s meant as a quick demo only.</p>

<p>So&#8212;what are your thoughts? Post a comment here or send me email. Thanks!
