I&#8217;m going to be writing about new NetNewsWire features for the next few days... Here&#8217;s another one: HTML differences.</p>

<p><img src="http://ranchero.com/images/htmldiff.jpg" height="72" width="367" alt="HTML differences screenshot" /></p>

<p>It&#8217;s off by default. You turn it on via the General prefs panel, where it asks if you want to highlight differences for updated items.</p>

<p>Deleted text is struck through and red; new text is green and underlined.</p>

<p>This is another one of those features that I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d like, but NetNewsWire users asked me for it. <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/">Aaron Swartz</a>, in particular, wanted this feature&#8212;and he said we could use his script in NetNewsWire. (So if you look inside NetNewsWire&#8217;s bundle, in the Resources directory you&#8217;ll find htmlDiff.py, Aaron&#8217;s Python script for showing HTML differences.)</p>

<p>So, if you like this feature, be sure to thank Aaron.</p>

<p>Now, as I said, I didn&#8217;t think that I personally would like this feature&#8212;but it turns out that I totally like it.</p>

<p>That leads to a little advice for app developers&#8212;<em>your users are smart</em>. The list of features I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d like, but that I did anyway because people asked for, is pretty much the list of cool features in NetNewsWire. (Groups, for one thing. The Combined View is another big one. And so on.)
