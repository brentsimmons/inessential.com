Here&#8217;s a great post by Chuq Von Rospach on <a href="http://www.plaidworks.com/chuqui/blog/000721.html">RSS and mailing lists</a>. If I had to name the world&#8217;s expert on mailing lists, it would be Chuq.</p>

<p>(One of these days I&#8217;m going to implement Trackback... but until then, it&#8217;s the old-fashioned method.)
