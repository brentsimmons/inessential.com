You have no idea&#8212;or maybe you do&#8212;how much email I&#8217;ve been getting about how RSS can and should help with the problem of email.</p>

<p>The growing consensus is that email is broken. It&#8217;s been broken by spammers and viruses. (And stupid-but-scriptable clients.)</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know if RSS is the answer or part of an answer or not.</p>

<p>When it comes to newsletters, I think it&#8217;s obvious that RSS is a great alternative. (Just ask <a href="http://rss.lockergnome.com/resources/articles/about.phtml">Chris Pirillo</a>.)</p>

<p>But what about mailing lists? Mailing lists are many-to-many. I love mailing lists; I subscribe to quite a few.</p>

<p>One possible solution is to have a weblog that people sign up to be able to post to. You can post but you can&#8217;t edit other people&#8217;s posts. You could comment on other people&#8217;s posts, though. And it would all be available via RSS.</p>

<p>This could be pretty nice, actually, assuming some good software for reading and writing. The important thing is that it be made as easy as joining a mailing list and reading and sending email.</p>

<p>So that leaves one-to-one and one-to-few email.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve learned that some people are creating private RSS feeds to solve this problem. Here&#8217;s how it works: say you and I correspond often. I&#8217;d create an RSS feed just for you. It would be password-protected and encrypted, of course. Instead of sending you email, I&#8217;d add a post to the feed, and it would show up in your newsreader.</p>

<p>And vice versa&#8212;you&#8217;d create a feed for me.</p>

<p>I find this idea rather difficult, though. If you correspond with lots of people, it means creating lots of feeds.</p>

<p>This could be turned around, I suppose. Each person could have a feed that anyone else could add to. Then, instead of knowing someone&#8217;s email address, you&#8217;d have the address of their feed. (Or, more precisely, the URL of some posting interface. You couldn&#8217;t read their feed, you could just add to it.)</p>

<p>That might be more do-able.</p>

<p>But then, if it took off, wouldn&#8217;t a stupid-but-scriptable client come along to break the whole thing? I&#8217;m not sure how RSS itself can prevent that. A stupid-but-scriptable client would still attract viruses and security problems.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m not proposing anything, just thinking about it, since I know that lots of you are thinking about this too.
