A few people have said that NetNewsWire 1.0.4 downloads feeds more slowly than earlier versions.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s true, in a way: it downloads <em>fewer feeds at a time</em> to minimize CPU use while downloading feeds.</p>

<p>However, this is completely in your control. You can make it download more feeds at a time. Here&#8217;s how:</p>

<p>1. Open NetNewsWire&#8217;s Preferences window.</p>

<p>2. Click the Downloading toolbar icon.</p>

<p>3. There&#8217;s a slider at the bottom of the window. Move it toward Faster, to the middle.</p>

<p>Me, I usually have mine set all the way to Faster, which works best for me, but you can try a few settings if you want and see what works best for you.</p>

<p>(The setting does not affect in any way the sites you&#8217;re downloading from, it controls only the number of feeds NetNewsWire downloads at a time.)
