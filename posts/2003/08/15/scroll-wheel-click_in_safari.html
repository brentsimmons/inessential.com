Here&#8217;s another I thing discovered in Safari. (Again, maybe it&#8217;s old news, but maybe not.)</p>

<p>If you have a mouse with a scroll wheel, then if you scroll-wheel-click on a link (or bookmark in the Bookmarks Bar), then the link will open in a new tab.</p>

<p>This is quicker than ctrl-clicking (or right-clicking) and choosing Open Link in New Tab.</p>

<p>(It probably requires that you have tabbed browsing turned on, of course.)
