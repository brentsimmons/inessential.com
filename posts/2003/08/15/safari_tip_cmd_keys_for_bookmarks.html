I discovered something in Safari last night&#8212;maybe this is ancient news, but it was new to me.</p>

<p>You can open any of the bookmarks in the Bookmarks Bar by typing cmd-[some-number]. The leftmost is cmd-1, the next one is cmd-2, etc.</p>

<p>As someone who uses the Bookmarks Bar and who likes not to use the mouse, this is quite nice.
