Dave Winer <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/08/18#wiredOnAggregators">writes</a> today about how there are mail-reader-type aggregators and weblog-type aggregators, and that weblog-type aggregators are better.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a false dichotomy.</p>

<p>The thing is, the mail reader aggregators are not very much like mail readers. They are smart about what they&#8217;re displaying. On the surface they look like email apps, but it&#8217;s not a simple substitution, news items for email.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll use NetNewsWire as an example, not because it&#8217;s unique in this regard but because I know it well.</p>

<p>Many aggregators have a concept of groups. (They don&#8217;t all work exactly the same, of course.) In NetNewsWire, if you select a group, you see the unread news of everything contained in the group. Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/macgroup.jpg">screen shot</a> showing my Macintosh group this morning.</p>

<p>So&#8212;is this weblog-style or mail-reader-style?</p>

<p>NetNewsWire, like some other aggregators, also lets you just see all the unread headlines regardless of group. Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/newheadlines.jpg">screen shot</a>. Here&#8217;s another screen shot which shows a more <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/newheadlines2.jpg">email-like view</a>, but still has items from multiple places in the same view.</p>

<p>NetNewsWire is by no means alone with features like this.</p>

<p>A good question might be&#8212;well, why not just use a browser-based interface like <a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio UserLand</a>?</p>

<p>I like Radio, by the way. I even did technical editing for an <a href="http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/kickstart/">upcoming book on Radio</a>. I like <a href="http://disobey.com/amphetadesk/">AmphetaDesk</a> too, which also uses a browser-based interface.</p>

<p>But a GUI app gives you a richer, targeted interface. A browser is generic: it knows it&#8217;s displaying HTML, but it doesn&#8217;t know it&#8217;s displaying syndicated news items. A GUI newsreader knows it&#8217;s displaying syndicated news items, and so the menu commands and toolbar buttons and shortcuts and everything are all about what it&#8217;s displaying. This allows you to keep up with more news with less effort.</p>

<p>It comes down to personal preference, though. Browser-based interfaces have their advantages too.</p>

<p>The thing to remember is that the distinction between aggregator types isn&#8217;t between mail-reader style and weblog-style, it&#8217;s between GUI apps and browser-based apps.</p>

<p>Dave writes: &#8220;People who are just using mail-reader style aggregators are really missing something.&#8221;</p>

<p>Actually, no, they&#8217;re not.
