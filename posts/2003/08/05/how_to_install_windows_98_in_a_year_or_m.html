When I read Mark Pilgrim&#8217;s <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/08/04/xp">How to install Windows XP in 5 hours or less</a>, I was envious, because it sounds like it actually worked and it only took 5 hours.</p>

<p>Me, I&#8217;ve been working on a re-install on my Windows machine for about a <em>year</em>. It&#8217;s going okay, I guess, except sound doesn&#8217;t work yet and networking doesn&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t remember why I decided to do a re-install in the first place. There must have been a reason.
