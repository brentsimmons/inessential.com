Some people have said that the issue with not well-formed feeds and aggregators is a kind of prisoner&#8217;s dilemma.</p>

<p>In other words, if all aggregator developers pledged to reject not well-formed feeds, then that would be incentive for people to fix their feeds.</p>

<p>The reasoning goes like this: aggregator developers are handling not well-formed feeds as part of competing with other aggregators. If they all pledged not to do this, then they&#8217;d all be equal on this score.</p>

<p>But this isn&#8217;t correct. I don&#8217;t have NetNewsWire (try to) handle not well-formed feeds for reasons of competition. I do it because people already using NetNewsWire want to read these feeds. And I do it because future users will want to read these feeds too.</p>

<p>It has everything to do with wanting to produce quality software. I suspect the same is true for other aggregator developers.</p>

<p>By the way, I do often email people when they have bugs in their feeds. And I&#8217;m sure other aggregator developers do too. But we still need to do the best we can with feeds with bugs.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not our job to be syndication cops.</p>

<p>Our software should support standards, but it should also try to work with feeds with bugs, because that&#8217;s in the best interests of our users.
