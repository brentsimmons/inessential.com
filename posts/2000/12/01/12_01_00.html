<p>On <a href="http://www.worldaidsday.org/">World AIDS Day</a>, let me recommend <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0385267053">AIDS and Its Metaphors</a> by Susan Sontag, a book that examines how the language we use when we talk about AIDS distorts our understanding of the disease. If there were a syllabus for adult life, this would be on it.</p>
