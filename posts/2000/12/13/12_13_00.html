<p>I added a new top-level section to my directory: Software Development. It contains two new directories, one for <a href="http://editorial.inessential.com/directory/1100/softwareDevelopment/~1111~">Version Control</a> and another for <a href="http://editorial.inessential.com/directory/1100/softwareDevelopment/~1110~">Design Patterns</a>. Please feel free to suggest links -- it totally helps.</p>
