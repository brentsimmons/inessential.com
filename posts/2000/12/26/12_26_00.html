<p>On Linux I run Netscape, and I&#039;ve always been bugged by how poorly it renders so many sites. Then I discovered I could turn off support for style sheets -- and now it works much better. (On the Advanced panel in the Preferences dialog box, uncheck Enable Style Sheets.)</p>

<p>In other words, Netscape&#039;s CSS support is so bad that no support at all is better. But that&#039;s not news to anyone.
