<p><a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/stories/storyReader$4277">Radio UserLand 7.0b32</a> has been released. It includes two new commands, Save As HTML and Save As Plain Text. The first renders an outline and saves it to disk; the second allows you to create and edit plain text files in Radio -- which means you could edit Python scripts in an outliner, for instance.
