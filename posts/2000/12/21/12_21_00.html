<p><strong>Little bits of software</strong></p>

<p>Here are a couple small things I like point to every now and again, in hope they&#039;ll be useful to somebody besides me. I myself use these pretty much every day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ranchero.com/software/webFileTypes/index.html">Web File Types Contextual Menu Plugin</a><br />
For Mac users, a utility that makes it easy to set the type and creator codes for downloaded Frontier files. You know the drill -- you download a guest database and need to deal with the type and creator codes before opening it. With this utility it&#039;s a click away.</p>

<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2000/06/01.html">Validate HTML and Validate CSS Bookmarklets</a><br />
For any browser that understands JavaScript bookmarklets. You can validate the HTML and CSS of the frontmost page displayed in your browser with a single click. This is useful not only for standards compliance but for fixing bugs -- the validator will tell you about unclosed tags, for instance. (Note: scroll down on the page linked to above to find the bookmarklets.)
