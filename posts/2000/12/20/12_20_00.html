<p>We note with great sadness <a href="http://www.ireland.com:80/newspaper/world/2000/1220/wor20.htm">Kirsty MacColl&#039;s untimely death</a>.</p>

<p>How many hours have we all spent singing along -- half-drunk, surrounded by good friends -- to Fairytale of New York?</p>

<p><em>It was Christmas Eve, babe<br />
In the drunk tank<br />
An old man said to me,<br />
"Won&#039;t see another one."</em></p>

<p>I was at the barbershop the other day. In the chair to the left of mine a young boy was getting his hair cut.</p>

<p>The boy was joking about what his older brother was going to get for Christmas. It was apparent that the boy and his older brother were both regulars -- all the barbers had greeted the boy by name when he came in, and they knew who his older brother was.</p>

<p>The boy was saying his older brother was bad. So he was going to get a lump of coal for Christmas.</p>

<p>No! Worse -- he was going to get a doll&#039;s eye for Christmas.</p>

<p>"A doll&#039;s eye?" one barber asked and looked at another barber.</p>

<p>"A doll&#039;s eye, yes, the eye of a doll," the other barber said.</p>

<p>"Not a doll&#039;s eye," the boy said, changing his mind. "He&#039;s gonna get coffee!"</p>

<p>Reader&#039;s Digest. It would be so easy to knock them -- but knocking the obviously and contentedly low-brow is a sure sign of Philistinism. (College kids and hipsters, take note.)</p>

<p>I mention Reader&#039;s Digest because the slice-of-life bit above reminds me of how, when I was a boy, I used to read all the jokes. Which led to dreaming of how I could write those jokes -- and get paid for it. Reader&#039;s Digest always used to have a page saying how much they paid for the jokes. It was alot of money! Or so it seemed to me as a twelve-year-old.</p>

<p>My friends and I used to fantasize about how we&#039;d be rich from writing jokes, and what that would be like, to have all this money for baseball cards, banana seats, Star Wars action figures, and the deluxe version of Monopoly.</p>

<p>Except this one friend, a Mormon, who said he&#039;d put the money in his missionary fund. Which was a jar of money sitting on top of his dresser. He fantasized about having more money saved up than any other boy in his church.</p>

<p>The rest of us thought he was crazy. He already had alot saved up, almost a hundred dollars.</p>

Still singing "Galway Bay"<br />
And the bells are ringing out --<br />
For Christmas Day.</em>
