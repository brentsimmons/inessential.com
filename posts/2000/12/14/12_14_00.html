<p>A-Rod&#039;s off to Texas, to play for the Rangers. I thought I&#039;d be more upset about this. But by now we&#039;re used to our superstars leaving town.</p>

<p>The irony is that the Mariners keep getting better. Last year, the first year post-Griffey, we almost made the World Series. And this year, with the signings of Ichiro Suzuki and Jeff Nelson and with the return of Lou Piniella, we may go all the way.</p>

<p>Sure, I&#039;ll miss A-Rod. But I&#039;m not concerned about the team itself. If the Mariners stay healthy and play up to their potential, they could win it all.</p>

<p>George W. Bush is my president.</p>

<p>That&#039;s not my choice -- but that&#039;s okay.</p>

<p>I&#039;m proud of my country today. Our processes may seem odd to non-Americans (or even to Americans), but what we&#039;re doing is trying to attain fairness. (Sheila called Americans fairness junkies.) One of our methods is the adversarial method -- two groups battle, and at the end we expect fairness.</p>

<p>I&#039;m a fierce partisan Democrat. Do I feel like the process was fair? Yes. Had it ended sooner, I might not have. It&#039;s hard to tell.</p>

<p>Now I&#039;m very interested in the future. All the talk is of Bush bringing the country together, reaching across party lines.</p>

<p>I don&#039;t know what this would be like.</p>

<p>There are lots of issues where the Republicans are on one side and Democrats on another, and there is no compromise. School vouchers, for instance, or a flag burning amendment. Where&#039;s the bi-partisan ground?</p>

<p>I don&#039;t see it. So all this talk about working together seems right now like just talk. I haven&#039;t heard any specifics. I&#039;m having a hard time imagining specifics.</p>

<p>If Bush (and the rest of the U.S., including me and you) can find the places where we can come together, and do good things for the country, I&#039;ll be amazed and pleased. It&#039;s a hard job.</p>

<p>More than anything, I want what&#039;s right and fair for the country and her people. This goes way deeper than partisan politics.</p>

<p>For my part, I&#039;ll start by working to keep an open mind.</p>

<p>All I have right now are questions. That&#039;s good, I think, that&#039;s the way to begin.</p>

<p>Only a Mariners fan would point out that George W. Bush is the former owner of the Texas Rangers, our AL West rivals, new home of that shortstop guy.</p>

<p>Texas Texas Texas. I was recently there, for the first time in my life. I caught connecting flights in Houston on my way to and from New Orleans for the EDevCon conference. But being in the Houston airport isn&#039;t quite the same as being in Texas. So, I&#039;ve been there, but only technically.</p>
