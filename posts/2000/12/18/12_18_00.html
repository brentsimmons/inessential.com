<p>I&#039;ve always resisted listening to NPR -- "yuppie scum radio" I&#039;ve always called it.</p>

<p>But I&#039;ve succumbed. I&#039;m listening to NPR now. The problem is, there&#039;s no good alternative.</p>

<p>So, here I sit, true to my demographic group.</p>

<p>Next thing you know I&#039;ll be fussy about beer, preferring cloudy black bitter dregs to the eminently drinkable Miller High Life.</p>

<p>Shoot me before I start praising Northwest cuisine and its habit of perverting every dish that&#039;s good and true with salmon, mushrooms, and wild greens.</p>

<p>You call this fettucine alfredo? I call this fish salad.</p>

<p>Jake <a href="http://editorial.inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$1121?mode=day">likes fish salad</a>. Jake&#039;s an extremely likable fellow, but we don&#039;t let him cook for us.</p>

<p>There are a couple links on Scripting News today regarding Web pads. (Web pad: a tablet, no keyboard, with a browser. Pen-based input. Wireless. Larger than a pda.)</p>

<p>As a fan of the small, lightweight, and portable, I&#039;ve wanted a Web pad for a long time.</p>

<p>I bought an iBook and an Airport -- so I sort of have one. I can browse the Web in my living room. I can sit outside. It&#039;s cool.</p>

<p>But it&#039;s still too large for when all I&#039;m doing is reading. (Which I do a lot of.)</p>

<p>My guess is that the first Web pad I buy will run a version of Linux and Mozilla (or perhaps Opera). Partly because I&#039;m not a fan of the Windows GUI, but also because the economics are probably better. I suspect they&#039;ll be cheaper -- and for Web pads to do well, they&#039;ll have to be inexpensive.</p>

<p>Also, I expect a Linux pad to be hackable in ways that a Windows pad would not be. Reminder to Web pad developers: the set of early adopters overlaps the set of hackers.
