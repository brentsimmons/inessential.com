<p>New macro: <a href="http://macros.userland.com/basic/includeHttp">includeHttp</a> includes the text returned by an HTTP request in a Manila-generated Web page.</p>

<p><a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/">Sheila</a> wrote a new sample macro: <a href="http://samples.userland.com/stories/storyReader$196">workspace.randomLine</a> returns a random line from a discussion group message, so you can do things like a random quote generator.</p>

<p>Another new sample is from Emmanuel DÃ©carie: <a href="http://samples.userland.com/stories/storyReader$195">Sending a file with tcp.sendMail</a>.</p>

<p>"frontier423.gif"</p>

<p>I still maintain a server running Frontier 4.2.3. I rarely have to actually use Frontier on that machine, but today I did. I felt like taking a screenshot.</p>

<p>This server is the descendant of the first server I ever ran. There are files that date back to 1995.</p>

<p>The hard drive is named Jeeves. At the time I thought that was a cute name for a server.</p>

<p>The server originally ran Frontier 4.0b1, aka Aretha.
