<p>Having just missed the 3 o&#039;clock workshops, I&#039;m coming at you live from the "Online Nerve Center." (A big room with a bunch of computers.) It&#039;s an instance of Manila appreciation: I can update my site. Which may seem like a ho-hum notion by now -- except it&#039;s not, really.</p>

<p>When I launched IE, the home page was set to <a href="http://www.astoundingweb.org/">Astounding Web Sites</a>. Cool.</p>
