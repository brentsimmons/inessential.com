<p>How to use Radio as an editing tool for <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/radioAsASlidesEditingTool">slides in Manila</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s a <a href="http://slides.createastandard.com/slides/9/1">slideshow</a> on the subject.</p>

<p>On <a href="http://inessential.com/2000/11/14.html">Nov. 14</a> I asked for advice about flat screen LCD monitors.</p>

<p>And now I have one -- delivered today was a <a href="http://www.samsungelectronics.com/products/monitor/770tft_2.html">Samsung 770TFT</a>. It has a 17" screen (equivalent to 19" in a glass monitor). Comfortable reading resolution is 1280 x 1024.</p>

<p>It was originally planned for my Mac desktop machine -- but it had to compete with the Trinitron I&#039;m currently using there, and it couldn&#039;t. No matter what I did with the settings, it was either washed out or muddy. Tried it with both OS 9 and OS X -- it wasn&#039;t that good.</p>

<p>So I set it up for my Windows and Linux desktops. (Which share a monitor via a KVM switch.) And there it&#039;s beautiful -- for whatever reason, it&#039;s great with Windows 2000 and Linux running GNOME. It&#039;s sharp and bright, easy to read. It&#039;s more readable than the glass monitor I had been using.
