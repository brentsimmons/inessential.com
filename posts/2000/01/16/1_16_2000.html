<p>I&#039;m working on Pike.</p>

<p><a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/qube/">Qube Quorner</a> today pointed to a page on Macintouch about speeding up Mac <a href="http://www.macintouch.com/browserperf.html">browser performance</a>. I tried the advice for both Netscape and IE 4.5. What a difference! It&#039;s most dramatic in IE, which was completely unusable on my machine. Now it feels much like IE 5 on Windows, which is the fastest browser I&#039;ve used. I&#039;m actually looking forward to IE 5 for Macintosh. I was very skeptical, but now I think there&#039;s hope.</p>

<p>For me, the problem&#039;s been this: I do email on my Mac and web-browsing on my Windows machine. This is because nothing compares to Eudora/Mac on Windows (not even Eudora for Windows). But there&#039;s no Mac browser as good as IE 5 for Windows. I don&#039;t care which I use more often, Mac or Windows, I just want to do web browsing and email on the same machine.</p>

<p>More from Qube Quorner: the <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/qube/stories/storyReader$239">Web in Review</a> covers the last week of news. It was a big week!</p>

<p>I just took the LinuxNewbies <a href="http://linuxnewbies.editthispage.com/bd_quiz/quiz20000116">Sunday BrainDrain Quiz</a>. I got them all right! (Yes, I&#039;m proud.) But here&#039;s my question -- how&#039;d he do that? Looks like client-side scripting. I bet other Manila editors would like a HowTo on setting up quizzes. The LinuxNewbies site has not stopped delighting me.</p>

<p>Seattle, normally on the blurry line between habitable and inhabitable, is today firmly across that border. Wind gusts up to 60 mph <a href="http://www.seattleinsider.com/weather/">are expected</a> -- I think we&#039;re seeing them already. Lights are flickering. I&#039;ve got UPS units, but they won&#039;t stand up to a longer power outage.</p>

<p>The 520 floating bridge has been <a href="http://www.seattleinsider.com/news/2000/01/16/wind.html">closed</a>. Here&#039;s the <a href="http://www.seattleinsider.com/community/yourtown/traffic/midspan520.html">bridge cam</a>. Look ma, no traffic.</p>

<p>There have been <a href="http://www.seattleinsider.com/news/2000/01/16/powerout.html">power outages</a> in the Puget Sound area.</p>
