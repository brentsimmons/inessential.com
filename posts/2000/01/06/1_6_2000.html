<p>Last night I watched Steve Jobs&#039; <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdtv/zdtvnews/features/story/0,3685,2410034,00.html">Macworld keynote</a>.</p>

<p>I went into it already knowing what my dream workstation is. It&#039;s a Linux machine with a great desktop. As much as I like <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> -- and would prefer it to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Windows</a> <em>in a heartbeat</em> if it had a web browser as good as IE 5 -- neither KDE nor <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> are great desktops.</p>

<p>Mac OS X is BSD, not Linux, but that works for me, it&#039;s close enough.</p>

<p>But is it a great desktop? I don&#039;t know, not having used it. It might be, it might not be. I liked the non-modal Save dialogs; the dock; the use of color and transparency (I&#039;m an unapologetic sucker for great eye candy); large and resizable icons; the display of a window&#039;s contents while moving it; the new Finder.</p>

<p>Perhaps the new Finder is what I liked best -- the ability to browse in place, without opening lots of windows, is something I want, a feature I&#039;ve liked in other desktops but felt was poorly implemented. (I used to use <a href="http://www.macinsearch.com/infomac2/disk/gregs-browser-254.html">Greg&#039;s Browser</a> on my Mac years ago, a Next-ish style browser, which was pretty nice.)</p>

<p>The thing I liked least was the Apple logo centered at the top of the screen. The first thing I thought -- no joke -- was that it was like when you get a pimple on your nose, right between your eyes. It hurts. Could I learn to look at it without feeling phantom acne pain? If not, it&#039;s a deal-stopper.</p>

<p>Switching gears... iTools sucks. It&#039;s all about lock-in and control. At best, I&#039;m neutral about it, because I wouldn&#039;t use it by choice anyway. But really, no, it sucks, and I wish Apple would drop it. I also wish Microsoft didn&#039;t do this kind of stuff.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://www.inessential.com/sheila/">wife</a>, who watched the keynote with me, had this to say about iTools: "Well, none of it&#039;s cool like Manila anyway."</p>

<p>Mark Cidade <a href="http://marxidad.editthispage.com/2000/01/05">writes</a> about typos: "I wish I was managing editor of the whole Web (which would all run on Manila-based technologies) and just press the Edit This Page button on any page I go to, to fix it up. That would be nice."</p>

<p>Atlanta Braves pitcher John Rocker to <a href="http://www.cnnsi.com/baseball/mlb/news/2000/01/06/rocker_tests_ap/index.html">undergo psychiatric testing</a>, as ordered by major league baseball. Look -- this makes political correctness a health issue. How very <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0060929871">Brave New World</a> of baseball. You want to give him a test, give him an IQ test.</p>
