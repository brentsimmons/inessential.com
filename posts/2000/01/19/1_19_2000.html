<p>The text of <a href="http://www.oursquare.com/members/STCanon/PierreMenard.htm">Pierre Menard, author of Don Quixote</a> is on the web. This is one of my favorite stories. Pierre Menard, a 20th century writer, has composed fragments of Don Quixote which match Cervantes&#039; original word-for-word. But how different the two versions are! In the story, two identical passages are compared: "Equally vivid is the contrast in styles.  The archaic style of Menard - in the last analysis, a foreigner - suffers from a certain affectation.  Not so that of his precursor, who handles easily the ordinary Spanish of his time."</p>
