<p>Jean-Paul Sartre: "Hell is other people."</p>

<p>Me: "Hell is other people&#039;s servers."</p>

<p>One of the servers we rely on is run by someone else -- and suddenly last night it started behaving very badly. Nuts.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> Problem solved. Our systems improve as a result. Instant evolution.</p>

<p>I&#039;m reading <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=65JPU209TZ&mscssid=0D60VBBLQTS12KR80017QUW4DLQ32P78&srefer=&isbn=0140239405">Strange Pilgrims</a>, a collection of stories by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. The stories are about Latin Americans in Europe.</p>

<p>In "The Saint," the main characters visit the Villa Borghese zoo to see the lion:</p>

<p>"He seemed to roar at all of us without distinction, yet the keeper knew right away that he roared only for Margarito. It was true: Wherever he moved the lion moved, and as soon was he was out of sight the lion stopped roaring."</p>
