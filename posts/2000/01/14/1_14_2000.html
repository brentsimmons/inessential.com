<p>From Kip DeGraaf, a <a href="http://www.deja.com/getdoc.xp?AN=449499787">page on deja.com</a> that may help in my quest to get symbols from WINE.</p>

<p>LinuxNewbies: <a href="http://linuxnewbies.editthispage.com/dnt/20000114">The Linux Kernel: An OS In a Nutshell</a>. This is the best Linux site in the world, a site I admire and enjoy without reservation. Don&#039;t miss the <a href="http://linuxnewbies.editthispage.com/faq">FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>Because I get webmaster@userland.com email, my email address is at the bottom of thousands of pages on UserLand.Com sites. Perhaps some of my readers are in similar situations -- you get the webmaster email for a large, popular site. Do you get a certain percentage of random email? I&#039;m not going to reprint any, but I get stuff like, "For my doctor&#039;s dissertation I&#039;m writing about JavaScript and object-oriented scripting. What are your thoughts on JavaScript syntax?" (This one&#039;s made up, but it&#039;s similar to actual emails.) Or: "I&#039;m on _____ and I can&#039;t figure out how get email from _____?" Or: "I had a hard drive crash. What can I do to get my spreadsheets back?" (These are all made up, but similar to the actual emails I receive. You get the gist.) I don&#039;t reply, I just marvel at the syndrome itself. In a way, it&#039;s cool, people are expecting other people on the net to be helpful. But, golly.</p>
