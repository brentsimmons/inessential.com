<p><a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com/2000/01/25">Andrea</a> starts a weblog! "I live in Bonn, Germany, where I share a nice little flat with André Radke, my boyfriend."</p>

<p>I discovered that my <a href="http://www.ccps.org/ccps/ehs/titlepage/titlepage.html">high school</a> in Cecil County, MD has a website. So does my <a href="http://www.ccps.org/ccps/cecilm/home/home2.html">elementary school</a> and my <a href="http://www.ccps.org/ccps/chms/home/home.html">middle school</a>. Amazingly, some of the same teachers are still there, even in my elementary school. They&#039;ve been there for decades.</p>

<p>I&#039;m reading the Cecil County <a href="http://www.ccmagazine.org/blotter1-00.htm">police blotter</a> to see if it mentions any of my old friends.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s where I had my first job: <a href="http://scene.delawareonline.com/delaware-dg/profiles/schaefers/index.html">Schaefer&#039;s Canal House</a>. I was 16, a busboy.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.inessential.com/sheila/2000/01/24">Sheila reports</a> that Mariner third baseman Russ Davis is going to the San Francisco Giants.</p>

<p>I&#039;ll be at tonight&#039;s meeting of the <a href="http://www.wiredfool.com/2000/01/12">Seattle Frontier Users Group</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://phillyfuture.editthispage.com/2000/01/25">Philly Future</a> points to this page today. Karl writes: "I could just copy his pointers, but they are not about Philly, and it&#039;s just not right in my book." To Karl and everyone else: links are not original, commentary is. Feel free always to link to something I&#039;ve linked to. You don&#039;t have to give me credit. Now, of course, the Philly-ness of my links is another subject. I&#039;ve already written about TastyKakes. I could recount my intense joy at watching the <a href="http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com/u/baseball/mlbcom/1999/postseason/history/yby/1980.htm">Phillies beat the Royals</a> in the World Series in 1980.</p>

<p>Larry Bowa, shortstop for the magical 1980 Phillies team, is the new <a href="http://www.mariners.org/gameday/news/11-19b-99.asp">third base coach</a> for the Mariners. For me this is a reunion, seeing one of my boyhood heroes again.</p>

<p>DrinkBoy <a href="http://drinkboy.editthispage.com/2000/01/25">recommends</a> the Zig Zag Café on Western Ave. "While not over loaded with rare and exotic spirits, they did have a very good selection of spirits that aren&#039;t normally carried in Seattle bars. Cachaca, Pisco, and 15 year Laphroig among many others."</p>

<p>Salon: <a href="http://www.salon.com/people/bc/2000/01/25/bowie/index.html?CP=USE&DN=310">David Bowie</a>. "&#039;Glam rock&#039; depended on several post-Wildean propositions: among them, that aesthetics are more important than politics; that a performer should put on a performance, not just show up stoned in a macramé vest and sandals; that earnestness equals lack of imagination; that art is artificiality."</p>

<p>When I was a teenager, me and my friends, we called David Bowie "God." Teenagers are silly -- but we had a point.</p>
