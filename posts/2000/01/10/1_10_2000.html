<p>I recently had reason to buy airplane tickets. I was pleasantly surprised, when I went to the <a href="http://www.alaskaair.com/">Alaska Air</a> website, that they&#039;d made it easier than it used to be. From the home page you used to be a few clicks from the form page -- now the form is on their home page. Very smart! They know why I&#039;m there.</p>

<p>Indulging in nostalgia -- I still sometimes get email about <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/simmons/virtualpcplatformdoubler.html">this article</a> I wrote in 1997 about VirtualPC. By the way, that story was posted to the site via <a href="http://contentserver.userland.com/">ContentServer</a>, software that lets you post to a website via email. It would be cool to connect ContentServer and Manila.</p>
