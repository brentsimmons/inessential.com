<p>News flash! Sheila blows the whistle on <a href="http://www.inessential.com/sheila/2000/01/22">Sea Monkeys</a>. They "do not walk upright and wear cute outfits."</p>

<p>Some time today I&#039;m going to set up the Dell Linux box I got <a href="http://inessential.com/2000/01/20">Thursday</a>. I&#039;ll write about that experience -- I&#039;ll also do a HowTo for setting up Frontier to run under WINE.</p>

<p>Andr√©&#039;s getting into WAP for Manila: watch <a href="http://spicynoodles.com/">SpicyNoodles.Com</a> for progress.</p>

<p>I really wish <strong>Bob Bierman</strong>, <strong>Susan Victor</strong>, and <strong>Matt Neuburg</strong> would each start a weblog. (I&#039;ve made their names bold because it&#039;ll draw their attention as they scan this page.)</p>
