<p>I&#039;m going to watch the <a href="http://www.cnnsi.com/football/nfl/2000/playoffs/">Super Bowl</a> today. I&#039;ve missed it the last few years. I&#039;m hoping for a good game. I don&#039;t really care who wins. It ain&#039;t baseball.</p>

<p><em>Update 12:30 p.m.:</em> I learned that Dick Vermeil is the coach of the Rams. Vermeil was the coach of the Eagles when I was young. I was a big Eagles fan, back in the days of Ron Jaworski. So I&#039;m rooting for the Rams.</p>

<p>My dad&#039;s been staying with me for the last few days. He lives back East. I forgot to ask him to bring TastyKakes. We&#039;ve been doing dad-things -- including going downtown and going bookstore-hopping. I picked up <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0672315262">Teach Yourself Linux Programming in 24 Hours</a> and the latest copy of <a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/">Linux Magazine</a>. (I already subscribe to Linux Journal, which is published just about 10 blocks from here in sunny Ballard, WA.)</p>

<p>Question: for someone who wants to learn more about Linux programming in C, what resources -- both print and on the web -- are best? Send me email, to brent@userland.com, or reply to <a href="http://inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$100">this message</a> in the discussion group. Thanks!</p>

<p>Dad digs Manila, by the way. He works for _____, a large Eastern corporation, and has a need to communicate with people in the field, and sees the potential of Manila to make that easy. He bought a copy of <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=1565925157">Web Design in a Nutshell</a>, a book I refer to often.</p>

<p>Dan Gillmor has been updating his <a href="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/">weblog</a> from Davos. Very cool. Dan&#039;s weblog and the DavosNewbies site are hosted on the same server. Not that it makes a difference to the world -- just to me. What does make a difference is that they&#039;re both Manila sites, that Dan, no matter where he is -- Switzerland, Hong Kong, California -- can easily update his site.</p>

<p>I re-installed IE 5.01. It seems to have fixed the problem I was having. Every time I closed a browser window, the app would crash. Nuts.</p>

<p><em>Update 12:45 p.m.:</em> It just happened again. Re-installing didn&#039;t fix the problem. I guess I just won&#039;t close browser windows anymore. This is double-plus-ungood. I&#039;ve a mind to drive over to the Microsoft campus and knock on the first door I come to until I get some service here. Let me hear ya -- can I get a witness?</p>

<p>Here&#039;s a site I&#039;m very excited about, a <a href="http://learnspanishquickly.editthispage.com/">Spanish newbies</a> site on EditThisPage.Com. I&#039;ve been trying to learn Spanish for a year, but I never make enough time. I realized that if I could learn it on the web, it would be much easier for me. And now there&#039;s a site.</p>

<p>The three pillars of education are mathematics, history, and languages. If I had to grade myself, I&#039;m failing math and getting a D-minus in each of history and languages. Nuts. I&#039;d like to fix that.</p>
