<p>I just wrote a new Frontier TechNote which explains how pages get sent via XML-RPC from a Manila site to a search engine server for indexing. If you&#039;re interested in Manila internals, or are having trouble getting your Manila site indexed, <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$2848">check it out</a>.</p>

<p>I got my Dell Linux machine set up. I&#039;m used to KDE, but I&#039;m giving GNOME another try. GNOME was the default.</p>

<p>A story on the setup process is coming. Getting a machine with Linux pre-installed is a joy. The hardest thing to do is set up networking -- which had me stumped for a while until I double-checked that the ethernet cable was plugged in all the way. It wasn&#039;t. Once I fixed that, everything worked.</p>

<p>I&#039;ve got WINE installed now too -- and Frontier is running, serving a Manila site.</p>
