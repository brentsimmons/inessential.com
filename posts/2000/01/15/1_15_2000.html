<p>News flash! Sheila reports that <a href="http://www.inessential.com/sheila/2000/01/15">Quicken 5 is not Y2K compliant</a>.</p>

<p>Yellow Dog Linux has created two new <a href="http://lists.yellowdoglinux.com/">lists</a> for users of Linux on Macintosh hardware.</p>

<p>Connectivity problems today: my ISP&#039;s upstream provider appears to have a router problem. So my ISP switched my routing to go through another network. It&#039;s better, but I&#039;m still seeing 15-30% packet loss most places. Some places I can&#039;t get to at all. Hell.</p>

<p><em>Update 3:45 p.m.:</em> It was a problem with a router at <a href="http://www.uunet.com/">UUNET</a>, which appears to be fixed now. I&#039;m getting 0% packet loss to scripting.com.</p>

<p>Speaking of hell -- before the Simpsons, Matt Groening did the Life in Hell comics. They were a huge hit when I was in college. Barnes and Noble doesn&#039;t seem to carry them, I can&#039;t get through to Borders right now, and I won&#039;t go to Amazon. If you see these books, buy them -- they may be out of print.</p>

<p>For people my age, 30-ish, all you have to do is mention Akbar and Jeff.</p>

<p>I went to the same college as Matt Groening, <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/user/home.htm">Evergreen State College</a>, a liberal arts school in dormant Olympia, WA. He was there a few years before me. Another great cartoonist, <a href="http://www.blairmag.com/blair5/lynda/">Lynda Barry</a>, also went to Evergreen.</p>

<p>When I was at Evergreen music was the thing. The biggest band was probably <a href="http://www.jjrecords.com/atomic/html/fish1.html">nomeansno</a>, which came in second in some indie video contest on MTV (if I recall correctly). <a href="http://geffen.com/nirvana/">Nirvana</a> played in dorm rooms, at keg parties, on the soccer field. The <a href="http://redrival.com/sweetoblivion/">Screaming Trees</a> were popular. My personal favorite was DangerMouse, named for the <a href="http://www.dangermouse.org/index.html">greatest secret agent in the world</a>. Two of my roommates were in the short-lived lansdatblister, pseudo-German for "lance that blister" (which no one got).</p>

<p>College was hell, btw. Evergreen&#039;s raison d&#039;etre was to provide a safe, woodsy setting for trust-fund hippies to smoke lots of pot. I was poor, more a New Wave kid than a hippie, and I&#039;m one of the unfortunates who react badly to pot: I get cranky and paranoid, then I throw up. Nuts. It&#039;s a physical thing. I can&#039;t drink milk, either, pretty much the same thing happens.</p>

<p>Popular Evergreen joke in the &#039;80s: Q: "Why did the &#039;greener cross the road?" A: "To get 15 credits."</p>
