<p><a href="http://frontier.userland.com/changes/611">Frontier 6.1.1</a> has been released! Lots of new Manila features and bug fixes.</p>

<p>I watched Wim Wenders&#039; <a href="http://aol.eonline.com/Facts/Movies/0,60,26207,00.html">Until the End of the World</a> again, one of my favorite movies, a modern Casablanca. Its themes of engagement and the <a href="http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue01/features/uteotw.htm">disease of images</a> energize me as much as they did the first time.</p>

<p>Of course, at the time the movie was made it was set in the future -- now much of it is set in the past. Which doesn&#039;t make the movie different, but me watching the movie, I&#039;m different. Still, the centerpiece of the movie, the moment that sticks with me, is when the power is cut on the small airplane, it&#039;s suddenly gliding over the Australian desert, and Claire and Sam wonder if there&#039;s a world below.</p>

<p>I just finished reading Italo Calvino&#039;s <a href="http://search.borders.com/fcgi-bin/db2www/search/search.d2w/Details?&mediaType=Book&prodID=3045873">The Road to San Giovanni</a>. More about that later, time permitting.</p>

<p>Update on installing Caldera OpenLinux -- it didn&#039;t work. It didn&#039;t recognize my hard drive. Nuts. So I gave the box away.
