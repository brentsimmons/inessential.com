<p>Dave has <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/01/27">updated Scripting News</a> from Davos.</p>

<p>I&#039;ve heard that <a href="http://www.rpg.net/quail/libyrinth/eco/eco.papers.html">Umberto Eco</a> will be at Davos. Of all the participants, he&#039;s the one I&#039;d most like to meet.</p>

<p>Now it&#039;s super-easy to create a search page on a search engine server. Just use this new <a href="http://samples.userland.com/stories/storyReader$100">sample</a> script, a safe macro you can use in a Manila site that&#039;s on a search engine.</p>

<p>Can anyone explain to me why glass glasses dry in the dishwasher so much faster than plastic glasses?</p>

<p>Andr√© <a href="http://inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$92">writes</a>: "My guess is that since a glass glass probably has a greater heat capacity than a plastic glass, the remaining water is heated (somewhat) and it dries faster." Okay, I&#039;ll buy that.</p>

<p>I took the <a href="http://www.emode.com/tests/dog2.html?reload">dog test</a>. Turns out I&#039;m a German Shepherd. But I thought the test was kind of bogus -- for half the questions, none of the above would have been the better answer than what I chose. Still, if I had to be a dog, I&#039;d rather be a German Shepherd than any other breed. So maybe the test is accurate after all.</p>

<p>If it turned out I was a Cocker Spaniel I wouldn&#039;t have admitted to taking the test.</p>

<p>If a German Shepherd were a man, he&#039;d work hard, but when he wants to relax he&#039;d cook up a steak -- rare -- and eat it while watching Star Trek on TV. Okay, that&#039;s my life.</p>
