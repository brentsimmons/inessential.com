<p>New Manila features: you can turn off the title on the home page -- as on this site -- and you can include the title in your news day template. (Which I&#039;m not doing on this site.) Here&#039;s a <a href="http://brentsimmons.editthispage.com/">demo</a>.</p>

<p>I posted as a <a href="http://samples.userland.com/stories/storyReader$88">sample</a> the script that displays the list of links on the left and gives me an Edit button.</p>

<p>Seahawks lost. It was a good game, but... Oh well, it&#039;s just football, not like it was actually important, like say a Mariners game.</p>

<p><a href="http://kozmo.com/">Kozmo.com</a> is a cool service -- you can rent a movie via the web, they deliver within an hour. Last night was the first time I&#039;d used their service. No complaints, very smooth.</p>

<p>Also ordered dinner via <a href="http://food.com/">food.com</a>, which I&#039;d done before. What&#039;s interesting is that it appears they&#039;ve switched from <a href="http://www.vignette.com/">Vignette</a> StoryServer to Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/webobjects/">WebObjects</a>. They&#039;ve still got issues with performance -- while it&#039;s faster than when they used StoryServer, it&#039;s still slow. And there are lots of UI issues, it&#039;s more difficult than it should be to order food, I kept getting confused. Nevertheless, I expect I&#039;ll continue to use their service -- unless a competitor comes along.</p>

<p>My favorite web service (outside UserLand, of course) is <a href="http://www.homegrocer.com/">HomeGrocer.Com</a>. Easy to use site, on-time delivery, excellent meat and produce, friendly drivers. I&#039;ve probably had groceries delivered 30 times by now. My wife wondered if they&#039;d let their most regular customers in on their IPO. Okay, so we&#039;re dreaming. But I think they&#039;re going to make a million trillion dollars.</p>

<p>The Seahawks have made it to the playoffs for the first time since 1988. No matter the outcome, this is the <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/seahawks/html98/kell_20000109.html">last game</a> of any kind in the Kingdome, ever. Go Hawks!</p>

<p><a href="http://array.editthispage.com/2000/01/09">array</a>: "Manila could be a big, big solution for print designers."</p>

<p><a href="http://phillyfuture.editthispage.com/">Philly Future</a> is a cool weblog. But it&#039;s not the same as being there. I grew up just outside Newark, Delaware, in the Philadelphia sphere of influence. Most of my family lives in Pennsylvania, south Jersey, and Maryland. They send me TastyKakes. I wish I could buy TastyKakes in Seattle (or on the web). And that&#039;s not all -- Philadelphia has an unrecognized culture of excellent junk food, the best there is. I wish I could get Herr&#039;s cheese puffs, good pretzels, Frank&#039;s Black Cherry Wishniak. In Seattle you literally can&#039;t get the right kind of bread to make hoagies and cheesesteaks. It&#039;s a scandal! Even something simple like non-processed sliced American cheese is very rare. I wish I could go to Friendly&#039;s for a sundae.</p>

<p>My personal heaven is Casapulla&#039;s, a deli in Hockessin, Delaware with the best subs in the world and the full range of Philly-area snacks.</p>

<p><a href="http://inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$41">Karl Martino suggests</a> I try <a href="http://www.phillypretzels.com/">PhillyPretzels.Com</a>, which will FedEx the food I crave right to my door.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s another Philly food deliverer: <a href="http://www.libertynet.org/philfood/products.html">Philadelphia Favorite Foods</a>.</p>

<p>Anita Rowland of <a href="http://anitar.pitas.com/">Anita&#039;s LOL</a> reminded me about <a href="http://seattle.sidewalk.citysearch.com/E/V/SEAWA/0006/10/83/">Philadephia Fevre</a>, a Seattle deli that apparently serves cheese steaks and TastyKakes. I knew about them, but for some reason I thought they closed years ago.</p>
