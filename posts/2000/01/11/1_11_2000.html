<p>We&#039;re trying to get better debugging info from WINE: see "Wine debugging and function names". Can you help?</p>

<p>I got Frontier running under WINE on Linux on a Windows-free Linux machine! Here&#039;s the <a href="http://inessential.com/stories/storyReader$43">story</a> chronicling the steps I took to get this configured. I&#039;ll be writing a more coherent HowTo so other people can try this out easily. Thanks to everyone who&#039;s helped so far. I&#039;ll have more questions soon.</p>

<p>Frontier launches, I get the MDI and About windows (but no menus) -- and the HTTP server now works! It&#039;s able to serve a Manila site!</p>

<p>All the current crashes so far appear to be related to outline rendering: we&#039;re working on figuring out what&#039;s going on there.</p>

<p>Sheila&#039;s now using the Manila navigation graphics feature on <a href="http://www.inessential.com/sheila/">her site</a>. Don&#039;t miss the <a href="http://www.inessential.com/sheila/garden/photos">Garden Photos</a>!</p>

<p>I&#039;m trying to get some of my co-workers to start weblogs. They say the same things I said before I started this one. The standard reasons: I&#039;m too busy and I have nothing to say. I thought the same things -- but I&#039;ve found that running a weblog is a great way to be engaged with the web and the people who make it fun. I&#039;m sure this is a topic I&#039;ll return to, soon.</p>

<p>I&#039;m trying <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/oe/">Outlook Express</a> for Windows today. I&#039;m normally a Eudora/Mac user. As soon as I find something to praise about it I&#039;ll let you know.</p>

<p>I changed my contact lenses this morning, as I do every week or two. Early man paid attention to the growing season, the phases of the moon -- I pay attention to the phases of my eyesight, from sharp to blurry and the gradations in between.</p>
