<p>I haven&#039;t eaten regular breakfasts since I was a kid. Today&#039;s the second day of my new life as a breakfast eater. (Granny smith apple, plain bagel, coffee.) <a href="http://www.realage.com/">RealAge.Com</a> told me I was about a year and a half older than the calendar says. They said to eat breakfast. Eating breakfasts makes me younger. Eating I can do. The way I eat, I&#039;ll be younger in no time.</p>
