<p><a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/qube/2000/01/28">QubeQuorner</a>: Great links, as always, but also this: "I work with about a dozen programmers, and some of the best ones learned to program on their own. Only about four of the lot have CompSci backgrounds." Here at UserLand we have a mix, from people with lots of college computer science education to people with none. Everyone&#039;s good. (Much better than good.)</p>

<p>Me, I learned programming as a boy; I didn&#039;t study it in college. But neither did I learn it on my own. My parents, who were both programmers at the time, would lecture me at the dinner table on modular design. "Don&#039;t use GOTO, use GOSUB." I think, in the future, lots of kids will learn programming this way; I was one of the first.</p>

<p>Speaking of modular programming: I remember my first great lesson. The Apple II Plus stored its video in user-accessible memory. A large enough program, or enough data, would cause the screen to display complete garbage, as the program or its data ran into video memory. I had written a huge adventure type game -- I was a fan of the classic Colossal Caves adventure -- where each room was a separate routine with its own input loop, its own hard-coded data, its own command handlers. No subroutines, no factoring, no central event loop, no design -- just a sprawling huge app. The program ate up all the available memory, went right up into video memory, and started drawing garbage on the screen. Time to re-architect! I was 12 or 13 at the time. So I learned that lesson early, the hard way.</p>

<p>I thought the computer was busted, but Dad knew what the problem was.</p>

<p>I almost started laughing, because as I&#039;m reading this I&#039;m wearing black jeans and a black T-shirt, as I do pretty damn often. But no glasses. And, far from being unable to take sunlight, I&#039;m one of its most enthusiastic, though infrequent, consumers. (Infrequent because this is Seattle.)</p>
