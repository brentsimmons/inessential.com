<p>Working on Pike today.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/space/01/20/space.eclipse.01/index.html">Jaguar to eat moon tonight</a>.</p>

<p>If you don&#039;t like tomatoes, you&#039;re <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/living/RubinReport/rubinreport.html">probably mentally ill</a>. "qbullet.sidesmiley"</p>

<p>I turbo-charged the graphics on <a href="http://www.inessential.com/sheila/">Sheila&#039;s site</a> last night. If you&#039;re a Frontier server manager, you can do the same for your Manila sites using the <a href="http://samples.userland.com/stories/storyReader$95">Copy Pictures to Static Server</a> sample script. Now pages like the <a href="http://www.inessential.com/sheila/garden/photos">Garden photos</a> page load <em>much</em> faster.</p>

<p>It&#039;s here! I received shipment of a <a href="http://www.dell.com/us/en/biz/topics/linux_what.htm">Linux machine from Dell</a> today. Yes, you read that right. It&#039;s a Dell box with Red Hat Linux pre-installed. I&#039;ll write a story about what it&#039;s like to set up such a machine once I have time to actually set it up. Dell shipping Linux boxes is a sure sign that this is the year 2000.</p>

<p>My sister, a former econ professor, works for a cool startup in Seattle, <a href="http://www.apexlearning.com/">Apex Learning</a>. If you&#039;ve got RealPlayer G2, you can get a <a href="http://www.apexlearning.com/demos/microecon1.ram">demo</a> of one of their tutorials. That&#039;s my sister talking.</p>

<p>I&#039;ve been trying to use <a href="http://northernlight.com/">Northern Light</a> as my search engine, but I keep getting bugged when I click on a link and I&#039;m expected to pay for the document. Forget it. I&#039;ll try using <a href="http://google.com/">Google</a> instead. I used to always use <a href="http://hotbot.com/">HotBot</a>, and <a href="http://www.altavista.com/">AltaVista</a> before that, and <a href="http://lycos.com">Lycos</a> before that, and <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> before that, but it seems like search engines always eventually hit a point where they start sucking. It&#039;s usually at the point where they add a Yahoo-like category scheme and call themselves a portal.</p>

<p>Garret Vreeland of <a href="http://array.editthispage.com/">array</a> suggests <a href="http://www.alltheweb.com/">alltheweb.com</a> as a search engine. It does appear to be quite fast.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.athens.net/~ewagoner/godot/godot.html">WebLog for Godot</a>. Waiting for Godot is one of my favorite plays. The tale of Didi and Gogo, who are hanging out, waiting. They can&#039;t go anywhere, as they&#039;re expecting Godot to show up. If it were a movie, it would be a buddy pic starring Bruce Willis and Jeff Goldblum. I can picture them now:</p>

<p>Goldblum: What about hanging ourselves?<br />

Willis: Hmmmm. It&#039;d give us an erection.<br />

Goldblum: (highly excited) An erection!</p>

<p>Modern audiences might wonder what&#039;s Godot&#039;s cell phone number. Call his sorry ass up and let him know he can&#039;t jerk people around like this.</p>

<p>Of course, if Didi or Gogo had checked their email before heading out, they&#039;d know that Godot had to reschedule. "Boys, I&#039;m going to need to make this happen next week. Same bat time, same bat channel. See you then. -Godot." (The previous joke is so old it wears suspenders.)</p>

<p>I saw Waiting for Godot at Seattle&#039;s Bathhouse Theatre in 1988. Sadly, the Bathhouse <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/news/entertainment/html98/bath_020299.html">closed last year</a>. Nothing to be done.</p>
