<p>Andr√©&#039;s new weblog: <a href="http://spicynoodles.com/">SpicyNoodles.Com</a>.</p>

<p>I need your help. I&#039;ve got a digital video camera, a <a href="http://www.canondv.com/ultura/index.html">Canon Ultura</a>, and I&#039;d like to be able to import still pictures and movies to my computer, then edit them. I&#039;ve got a G4 with FireWire, so I know the connection can be made. Of course I need a cable. But what software do I need? I don&#039;t want to spend a grand on this. Still pictures have the priority over movies, so if there&#039;s a solution that works only for pictures, for now that&#039;s okay. <a href="mailto:brent@userland.com">Send me email</a> or reply to <a href="http://inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$68">this message</a>.</p>

<a href="http://www.rebeccablood.net/">rebecca&#039;s pocket</a><p>If you&#039;re a Seattle-ite, and I missed your weblog, let me know: send email to brent@userland.com or reply to <a href="http://inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$68">this message</a> in the discussion group.</p>

<p>I like the design of the <a href="http://theaperture.editthispage.com/">The Aperture</a>, a new EditThisPage.Com site. I like the bold use of orange. It&#039;s another newbies site, this time for amateur photographers.</p>

<p>I have no confidence in <a href="http://www.crn.com/dailies/digest/breakingnews.asp?ArticleID=13070">iPlanet Web Server</a>. It costs $1,495, and it&#039;s based on Netscape FastTrack, which hasn&#039;t been revised in two years. Hello? Apache is free, Apache is easy to use, Apache performs pretty well, Apache&#039;s probably already installed on your box. There are lots of websites and O&#039;Reilly books on Apache. Lots of software has been written for Apache. If I want something to do what Apache does, I&#039;ll use Apache. I can&#039;t imagine that iPlanet has some special gotta-have-it capability that Apache lacks. If I&#039;m wrong, let me know.</p>

<p>I would, of course, run a server other than Apache on Linux if that server hosts Manila sites!</p>

<p>Joshua Lucas of <a href="http://barista.editthispage.com/">BaristaLog</a> wrote me about iPlanet: "It isn&#039;t a

&#039;modern&#039; web server right now.  Doesn&#039;t support servlets without some

serious config file hacking which to me is just plain silly."</p>
