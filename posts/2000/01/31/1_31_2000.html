<p><a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$2904">UnInstall Site Bug Fix</a>. Manila is now smarter about removing entries from user.databases, members.root, and discuss.root when removing sites.</p>

<p><a href="http://manila.userland.com/changes/612">Editing form bug fix</a>: the edit form for a page could get messed up if the HTML in the page you&#039;re editing included certain tags. The fix was to convert ampersands, quotes, and left carets to HTML entities inside the textarea.</p>

<p>The server running EditThisPage.Com and WebLogs.UserLand.Com will be down for an upgrade tonight between 7 and 8 p.m. We&#039;re doubling the RAM, so the performance of this server should be much improved, less prone to glitches.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> Upgrade accomplished. EditThisPage.Com is back on-line. So far so good; the server appears happier.</p>

<p>HTML bug fixed in the <a href="http://samples.userland.com/stories/storyReader$100">Search Page</a> sample script. The closing &lt;/form> tag was missing, preventing the Edit this Page button from working on certain browsers.</p>

<p><a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$2893">Competing Indexers Bug Fixed</a>. Manila and mainResponder were duking it out for the right to index pages. Now the mainResponder indexer is Manila aware. It knows when to ignore a request and when to handle it.</p>

<p>Wired: <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,33974,00.html">The Penguin Has Landed</a>. The title of this piece is a little over-blown. The gist is that Andover.Net is adding services for enterprise users. And they&#039;re releasing and supporting the code that runs Slashdot.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s my experience and my thoughts on "Setting up a Dell Linux Box" with Red Hat Linux pre-installed. It worked!</p>

<p>The next story I plan to write is about getting Frontier set up on WINE, so you can duplicate my set-up. It&#039;s pretty easy, but there are a few gotchas. I&#039;m not sure when I&#039;ll get to writing this. This week, I hope.</p>

<p>I collected links people submitted yesterday and created a "Linux C Programming Links" page. It&#039;s in the navigation as Linux C, so you can&#039;t lose it. If you have links to add, just send email to brent@userland.com or reply to <a href="http://inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$105">this message</a> in the discussion group.</p>

<p>I&#039;m seriously considering buying <a href="http://www.metrowerks.com/desktop/linux/redhat/gnu/">CodeWarrior</a> for Linux. I&#039;ve used CodeWarrior alot on Macintosh, and like the Mac version very much. I prefer it to Visual C++ on Windows. But maybe I should get comfortable with the command line tools first.</p>

<p>Luke Tymowski <a href="http://inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$108">suggests</a> using something other than CodeWarrior.</p>

<p>Sheila figured out how to get images from our digital video camera into a computer. Here&#039;s a <a href="http://www.inessential.com/sheila/2000/01/30">spaceman</a>.</p>

<p>News.Com: <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-1534876.html?tag=st.ne.1002.bgif?st.ne.fd.gif.f">Alpha version of Mozilla makes debut</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/col/mill/2000/01/31/lennon_mccartney/index.html?CP=USE&DN=310">Two of Us</a>. Puke me out.</p>

<p>My dad was here for a few days, but now he&#039;s left. It was great seeing him! There&#039;s something so American and perfect about getting to watch the Super Bowl with one&#039;s Dad, something I haven&#039;t done in 15 years or more. And it was even a rare good game. But now, back to a regular work schedule...</p>
