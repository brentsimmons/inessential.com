<p>Apache will ship with <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/inside.html">Mac OS X</a> as a personal webserver. I wonder what this will be like. Will Perl and Python also be installed? Will there be many differences between this version of Apache and a more standard installation? I edit my httpd.conf files in emacs. Will emacs be installed? What about Apple events -- would it be possible to write a module to connect the built-in Apache to Frontier via Apple events? Better still, I hope Apache on Mac OS X will support the Mac CGI standard as implemented by <a href="http://www.starnine.com/webstar/webstar.html">WebSTAR</a>, <a href="http://www.tenon.com/products/webten/">WebTen</a>, and so on.</p>

<p>And, most importantly, will it be easy to turn Apache off and run Frontier (or other webserver)?</p>

<p>I wonder if Mac OS X will include <a href="http://us1.samba.org/samba/samba.html">Samba</a>. That would be cool by me, it&#039;s still too much of a pain to do file-sharing between Mac and Windows.</p>

<p>The fundamental question I have is this: Since Mac OS X is UNIX and Mac OS sort of blended together, do we get the best of both worlds, or do we get crippled versions of each, a hybrid that teases but doesn&#039;t satisfy? The former excites me, but I fear the latter.</p>

<p>To confuse the world a little bit more, there&#039;s a Tenon product for Mac OS X named <a href="http://www.tenon.com/products/itools/">iTools</a>. And there&#039;s Apple&#039;s <a href="http://itools.mac.com/itoolsmainpc.html">iTools</a>. Here&#039;s a HotBot search for <a href="http://hotbot.lycos.com/?MT=iTools&SM=MC&DV=0&LG=any&DC=10&DE=2&BT=H&Search.x=57&Search.y=14">iTools</a>. It&#039;s a fairly common name.</p>
