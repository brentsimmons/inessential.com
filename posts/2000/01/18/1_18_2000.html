<p>More Pike work today.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/storyReader$700">XML-RPC interface for Manila</a> is an essential part of the server-side support for Pike.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.be.com/products/freebeos/">Free BeOS</a> to be released later this quarter. "No repartitioning will be necessary, and launching BeOS 5 will be as simple as double-clicking an icon on the desktop."</p>

<p>There&#039;s a new <a href="http://benewbies.editthispage.com/">Be Newbies</a> site on EditThisPage.Com.</p>

<p>Yesterday I switched to <a href="http://www.eudora.com/">Eudora</a> 4.2 for Windows. I&#039;m now doing email and web browsing on the same machine. The long national nightmare is over. What&#039;s interesting to me is that my choice of desktop isn&#039;t dictated by my preferred OS, or the quality of apps in general, it&#039;s the quality of the web browser. And even with the speed boost my Mac browsers got on <a href="http://inessential.com/2000/01/16">Sunday</a>, IE 5 for Windows was still superior. What that says about the state of web browsers isn&#039;t good. What that says about the relative importance of web browsers is, however, good.</p>

<p>I considered Pine and Lynx. No joke. I didn&#039;t consider them for long, but I did think about what life would be like. Text-only interfaces have, for me, an undeniable allure. On the practical side, I do wish IE 5 and Lynx shared the same keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<p>Jay R. Ashworth of the <a href="http://baylink.pitas.com/">Baylink</a> weblog suggests <a href="http://www.mutt.org">mutt</a> over Pine.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s a table of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/books/winguide/appxB.htm">Windows shortcuts</a>. Is there a shortcut that minimizes just the frontmost window?</p>

<p>Jim Roepcke supplies the <a href="http://inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$64">answer</a>. Thanks, Jim!</p>
