<p>We moved some Weblogs.Com sites to another server tonight to help spread out the load. For the moved sites a DNS change was required -- so if you&#039;re having trouble getting to a particular Weblogs.Com site, it may be that the DNS change is still propagating. It may take a few hours.</p>

<p><a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/stories/storyReader$3610">Radio UserLand and Firewalls</a> -- a change was made in what happens when you click the Radio UserLand button to edit an object in a Manila site. It should now work for people behind firewalls.
