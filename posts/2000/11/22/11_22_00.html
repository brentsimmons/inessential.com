<p>Last night I installed Red Hat Linux 7 -- and was stunned by the improvements to the desktop. The last Linux desktop I&#039;d used was GNOME on Red Hat 6 -- which, like all other Linux desktops I&#039;d used, was just about unusably ugly. The big problem was the jaggy fonts; the second biggest problem was performance.</p>

<p>But now -- for the first time I&#039;m using a Linux desktop that isn&#039;t a piece of shit. Wow! I suspect it&#039;s <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86 4</a> that makes the difference. Fonts are readable; moving and re-sizing windows isn&#039;t totally slow. (Yes, I&#039;m running on the same machine that used to run Red Hat 6, so it&#039;s a fair comparison.) I will no longer scoff when people say that the Linux desktop has a chance of becoming fairly widely used. It does have a chance. (By "widely used" I don&#039;t mean that I think it will threaten Windows.)</p>

<p>Maybe I&#039;ll try installing a modern version of Netscape -- the old version (4.76) that was pre-installed just plain sucks. What a total shame. But I don&#039;t want to go into that today.</p>

<p>Speaking of Linux -- here&#039;s a pet peeve. I often run across comments sort of like this: "Well, Open Source rulez, because we can just clone Microsoft app xyz in a couple days, no big deal."</p>

<p>The merits of Open Source as a development philosophy aside (it has its strengths and weaknesses) -- this is just brain-dead strategy. If the main or only benefit to Open Source is that you can clone Microsoft products on Linux, then screw it. <em>I don&#039;t want Microsoft clones on Linux.</em> People who make those comments either miss the point of Open Source entirely, or they get the point, and the point is petty and stupid. I don&#039;t know which.</p>

<p>In other words, hey Linux guys, hey, please don&#039;t think of Microsoft as your GUI design lab.</p>

<p>To be clear -- I&#039;m talking about user interface. That GNOME, for instance, has a component architecture inspired by Microsoft is cool. SOAP is cool. Etc.</p>

<p>What I&#039;m saying is, I don&#039;t want to use an IDE on Linux that&#039;s a <a href="http://www.kdevelop.org/index.html?filename=screenshots1.html">clone of Visual Studio</a>. I don&#039;t want to use an email app that <a href="http://mahogany.sourceforge.net/screenshots.html">looks like Outlook Express</a>. No friggin&#039; way. <em>Spare me</em>.</p>

<p><em>Do better.</em></p>

<p>David Brown <a href="http://editorial.inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$1080?mode=day">writes</a>: "If all that happens is that Open Source clones Microsoft, then Microsoft has already won."</p>

<p>A reader sent me email reminding me of the reason for doing clones of Microsoft apps -- the idea is to make Linux comfortable for people used to Windows. (The reader didn&#039;t agree with this sentiment, btw.) I&#039;ve heard this argument many times. It&#039;s just depressing how with all this freedom and opportunity the first thing some people do is don the Microsoft hairshirt. With that attitude, failure is guaranteed.</p>
