<p><a href="http://manila.userland.com/howTos/soapManilaInterface">How to Enable the Manila SOAP Interface</a>. You can script Manila with SOAP as well as XML-RPC -- the handlers are the same, but now there are two protocols.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/manilaRpc">Manila RPC interface spec</a> has been updated. Here&#039;s an <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/storyReader$1079">overview</a> of the changes.</p>

<p>A new set of <a href="http://samples.userland.com/stories/storyReader$176">sample scripts</a> demonstrates scripting Manila with SOAP.</p>

<p>On TV last night I watched <a href="http://www.pbs.org/whatson/press/fall/ngs_returnofthewolf.html">Return of the Wolf</a>, about the re-introduction of wolves to Yellowstone Park. I like shows about animals in the wild, and will pretty much enjoy any of them -- but this one is special, better than most. Thumb&#039;s up from this reporter.</p>

<p>It&#039;s amazing how much <em>culture</em> wolves have -- they have surprisingly complex social structures and customs. They don&#039;t even seem like dogs, they&#039;re so smart. One of the best parts of Return of the Wolf was what happened when a wolf from another pack tried to join the Druid pack. There&#039;s a testing process that normally ends in acceptance or death for the wanna-be. Apparently this is the first time that process has been filmed.</p>

<p>You can&#039;t help feeling a little sorry for the coyotes. They&#039;ve had to look over their shoulder ever since the wolves came back.</p>

<p>But the most important thing -- something I&#039;d imperfectly understood until I watched this show -- is that wolves, when they&#039;re running, when they&#039;re hunting, are beautiful. It&#039;s not every day you get to see beauty on TV. Cuteness, yes, every day; alluring men and women, perhaps, depending on taste; but actual beauty on TV is rare.
