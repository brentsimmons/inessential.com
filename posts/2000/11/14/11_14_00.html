<p>Question: does anyone know of a good but not totally expensive flat panel monitor that displays at 1280 x 1024 that works with Macs? I don&#039;t want to spend $2000 on it. It may be that there is no such animal. (Apple has made a mistake, in my opinion -- they have no flat panel between the 15" and the 22" models. The 15" is too small and the 22" is way too expensive.)</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: Following <a href="http://editorial.inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$1063?mode=day">advice</a> from Garret, I went <a href="http://www.sgi.com/flatpanel/promotions.html">here</a>, to check out a deal on the Silicon Graphics flat panel. Anybody have experience with this monitor? Thumbs-up, thumbs-down?
