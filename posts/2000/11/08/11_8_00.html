<p>This has been one of the thrills of my life.</p>

<p>I watched CNN for about seven hours straight.</p>

<p>I still have hope that my guy will win...</p>

<p>No, not dogs and cats sleeping together!</p>

<p>Here&#039;s a theory about why the election is close. It&#039;s not that America is evenly divided between liberals and conservatives.</p>

<p>It&#039;s that Americans have taken a sharp turn toward the middle. A nation of moderates.</p>

<p>The voting is the result of what Sheila called the "coin-toss effect." If you&#039;re in the center, Gore&#039;s a little to the left, Bush is a little to the right. Which do you vote for? It&#039;s a coin toss.</p>

<p>I&#039;m not saying that any one voter flipped a coin. But in large numbers it&#039;s as if every voter flipped a coin.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s a consequence Nader may not have intended. Me, I&#039;m a liberal, and I give money to environmental organizations and other liberal causes.</p>

<p>In the future, I&#039;ll be checking to see if Nader is involved. If so, no money. It&#039;s a Nader boycott.</p>

<p>That guy has destroyed his good name among a certain part of his natural constituency. How large that segment is remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Michael Moore: <a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/2000_11_08.html">Stop Bush&#039;s Theft of the People&#039;s Will</a>! While I agree that the Electoral College is out-dated, I guarantee you that had Gore lost the popular vote but won the Electoral College and the presidency, I wouldn&#039;t give a shit about the right-ness of that ancient institution. It would be a sore loser who makes a big deal about it now. (In other words, Michael, please, a little class, please.)
