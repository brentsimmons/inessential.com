<p><strong>Vote!</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.shsw.wisc.edu/press/12153098.htm">Dewey Defeats Truman</a>! This may be the closest race since 1948. Your vote counts.</p>

<p>I&#039;m not reading any weblogs or other news sources today until after I vote. I cherish not knowing what the exit polls are showing, or what the mood is in each camp. I don&#039;t want to know what happened in Pennsylvania (etc.) until after I vote.</p>

<p>Sheila and I will be among the last Americans to vote, since we&#039;re on the West Coast, since we wait until after work to vote.</p>

<p>Around 7 we&#039;ll take the ritual walk to the polls, cast our votes, then come home and turn on CNN. Until then, I don&#039;t want to know what&#039;s going on.</p>

<p>It&#039;s a psychological thing, there&#039;s a euphoria associated with voting for your candidate that&#039;s much enhanced when you haven&#039;t heard the predictions. I treasure that feeling.</p>

<p>Btw, our voting place is in a church. I find that utterly appropriate.</p>

<p>David Brown <a href="http://editorial.inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$1039?mode=day">asked</a> why wait until after work to vote?</p>

<p>Here&#039;s why:</p>

<p>When I imagine the history of voting in America, I picture the factory workers, the farmers, all the working people over all the years of American democracy. They had to wait until after work to go vote. I&#039;m with them. Voting during the day is for rich people, the over-privileged, the elite. Etc. It&#039;s hokey, but it&#039;s a connection to the past, to the traditions of American democracy.</p>

<p>Me and Sheila, <em>we gotta work</em>. Then we go vote.</p>

<p>We went through the voters pamphlet last night. There weren&#039;t many tough calls. Sometimes some of the initiatives are difficult, but not this time. In Washington state the process has been simplified -- look for <a href="http://www.seattleweekly.com/features/9951/features-berger.shtml">Tim Eyman&#039;s</a> name. That&#039;s your first clue. If Eyman&#039;s name appears, chances are 99.99% that the opposite choice is both moral and practical. (Of course, you still have to read it and decide -- but I&#039;ve yet to see an Eyman-backed initiative that wasn&#039;t hand-crafted in Hell.)</p>

<p>My weblog is <a href="http://inessential.com/1999/11/07.html">one year old</a> today.</p>

<p>Sheila&#039;s weblog is <a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/1999/11/07">one year old</a> too.
