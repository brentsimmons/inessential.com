<p>I revised my <a href="http://editorial.inessential.com/directory/1095">Mac OS X</a> and <a href="http://editorial.inessential.com/directory/1097">Linux</a> directories. I&#039;m still learning, as many of us are, how to make good directories. At first it sounds easy -- but it&#039;s not. Making a directory is easy; making a good directory is a little harder.</p>

<p>It&#039;s a good idea to read the <a href="http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines.html">DMOZ guidelines</a>. Not all of it applies; some of it is specific to DMOZ. But the parts that do apply are valuable.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s what I&#039;ve learned today:</p>

<p>1. It&#039;s easy to over-categorize. If you have lots of categories with just a few links per category, consider flattening the directory.</p>

<p>2. Categories named "Resources" (or similar vague terms) are meaningless. Everything&#039;s a resource, right? If you have a category named Resources or Misc. or something like that, you probably want to put those items at the top level of the directory.</p>

<p>3. Consider maintenance. For instance, I had a list of software available for Mac OS X. It would be insane to attempt to make that comprehensive and up-to-date. Instead, I just point to the several sites that do attempt to have a comprehensive list of software. In other words, if someone else is maintaining a list that requires lots of maintenance, point to them.</p>

<p>4. Avoid as much as possible repeating the name of the category in the links. Now, sometimes the category name will be a major part of the name of a website, and you can&#039;t avoid it. But when you can avoid it, do so.
