<p><a href="http://frontier.userland.com/news/2000/11/06">Discussion group bug fixes</a> are listed on today&#039;s Frontier News.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s a <a href="http://wewriteresumes.editthispage.com/">site that makes great use of News Items</a>.</p>

<p>Each News Item is a job listing; each has a category (or department, in News Items terms). There are links to each department at the top of the home page, so you can see the job listings in each.</p>

<p>What I like is that, when we designed the feature, we weren&#039;t thinking about job listings. But it works, and the people doing the site recognized that and put it to good use. It&#039;s not a weblog, but that&#039;s okay, nothing says all Manila sites have to be weblogs.</p>

<p>Lately I&#039;ve been listening to <a href="http://king.org/">classical music</a> (on the radio no less, so low-tech of me). I don&#039;t know that much about classical music, and don&#039;t have much in the way of preferences. (Other than a vague dislike for the Romantics, preferring older stuff like Bach or newer stuff like Bartok and Stravinsky. Whatever.)</p>

<p>You&#039;ll never hear me say -- Wow, what an ingenious variation on the Sonata form!</p>

<p>Instead, I enjoy it in a low-tech way. What I like is that the range of melodic invention is so much greater than in pop/rock/blues etc. It&#039;s constantly surprising, and a constant reminder that there isn&#039;t just one or two or 10 ways of doing things, there are thousands. So it&#039;s a mental stimulant, a way of getting the neurons to fire in ways they&#039;re not used to.</p>
