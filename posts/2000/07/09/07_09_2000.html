<p>At the half-way mark, at the All-Star break, the Mariners are <a href="http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com/u/baseball/mlb/standings/alstandings.htm">51-35</a>, with a three-game lead in the AL West and the second-best winning percentage in all of major league baseball. My oh my!</p>

<p>I&#039;m so excited -- I just ordered an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ibook/">iBook</a> (graphite) and an Airport station. I&#039;ve wanted to be able to work outside for a long time. And I&#039;ve wanted a laptop for even longer, since before I even had a house with a yard. Yes, this will be my first laptop, unbelievable as it sounds.</p>

<p>Sometimes I like to price things. For instance, occasionally local Internet companies send email asking me to be in a focus group. (If you live in or near Seattle, you probably get these too.) They offer $50 for my time. No way. But how much would it take? I would do it for $1000, not less.</p>

<p>How much would would you have to pay me to read the new <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/bookshelf/children/harry_potter/review1.asp">Harry Potter</a> book? It&#039;s over 700 pages. I would read it for $3500, roughly $5 per page.</p>

<p>I don&#039;t mean it&#039;s a bad book, it&#039;s just so completely opposite my taste. Why mention it at all? Just to be contrary.
