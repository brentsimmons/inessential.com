<p>Sometimes I like to pretend to myself I&#039;m totally new to the Internet. I have conversations with myself.</p>

<p>"Hey, do you have that Internet program?"</p>

<p>"No, I wish I did, all I&#039;ve got is the email from that Yahoo."</p>

<p>I don&#039;t do it to be mean. I wonder if plumbers and electricians and auto-repair dudes joke like this? Probably. I have no idea what their jokes would be like -- in their worlds I&#039;m totally clueless.</p>

<p>"Hey, Mr. Plumber guy, I think I screwed something up -- &#039;cause now when I take a shower all the water disappears into this little hole."</p>

<p>We&#039;re gonna rock down to Electric Avenue.</p>

<p>And then we&#039;ll take it higher.
