<p>I caught <a href="http://vfih.editthispage.com/2000/07/13">John VanDyk</a>, dressed as a huge squirrel, trying to hide under the ivy out front. For John things have gone horribly wrong -- I&#039;ve got him locked up in a closet, I&#039;m trying to make him talk. All he&#039;ll give me is his name, rank, and Frontier serial number. So far.</p>
