<p>Dave asked for an RFC on a Manila Theme that uses the metaphor of the Basic Black dress. Though it was originally written for UserLand eyes, at Dave&#039;s suggestion I posted the un-edited RFC on this site.</p>

<p>"RFC: Basic Blog Theme".</p>

<p>(RFC means Request for Comments.)</p>

<p>We went to the circus -- Cirque du Soleil&#039;s <a href="http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/en/piste/saltimb/dermagie.htm">Saltimbanco</a> -- last night. Amazing!</p>

<p><a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/2000/07/16">Sheila</a>: "Sometimes when you see a person doing something wonderful, you feel like you can do something wonderful, too. Then I think you have seen something truly wonderful."</p>

<p>Theory: the <em>amazing</em> is one of the roots of art. We&#039;ve seen the cave paintings, but there are no recordings, of course, of cave people entertaining each other by juggling rocks or swinging from vines.</p>

<p>The amazing is usually an aspect of performance. Think of ballet. But sometimes composed arts can be amazing -- rhyming, strictly metered poetry, for instance, can be amazing. When I read Shakespeare&#039;s sonnets, I wonder: how the hell did he do that? Of course, I appreciate their beauty, but the simple feeling of amazement is still there. And that&#039;s not wrong.</p>

<p>It&#039;s also one of the roots of sport. Why watch baseball? Partly for the narrative aspects. (Every at-bat is a story. Every inning is a story. Every game is a story. Every season is a story.) But a big part of it is I want to see something amazing. I want to see the shortstop make a diving catch followed by an impossible throw to first to get the runner out by half a step.</p>

<p>Another amazing circus, and totally different from Cirque du Soleil, is the <a href="http://www.ambient.on.ca/jimrose/jimrose.html">Jim Rose Circus Sideshow</a>. Highly recommended. But not for children, people with pacemakers, or Mrs. Grundy.
