<p>Seattle scored three runs in the ninth last night to win the <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/news/2000/07/18/mariners_diamondbacks_ap/index.html">rubber match of the three game set</a> against NL West leading Arizona CryingBacks. <a href="http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com/u/ce/preview/0,2405,MLB_20000719_SEA@OAK,00.htm">Next up</a> is division rivals the Oakland A&#039;s.</p>

<p>This is prompted by a <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$4893">note</a> on the Frontier discussion group. "I&#039;d rather not use Apple hardware for this since my experience with Apple and webserving is a lot of crashes," writes Andreas Hellstrom.</p>

<p>My story: I have a Mac 8500 which had a problem a couple years ago. It was a very light-duty server, running Mac OS. It developed a problem -- about a minute after booting up, it would freeze, hard.</p>

<p>I took it into the shop. They replaced the hard drive. I completely re-installed the system software, re-installed the couple apps it needed to run. The problem resurfaced. I tried lots of different combinations to see if it would stop freezing. Nothing worked. I&#039;ve been running Mac servers since 1995; I have a clue about how to keep these things up.</p>

<p>Then, figuring I had nothing to lose, I installed <a href="http://www.linuxppc.com/">LinuxPPC</a> on it. It was that or throw the machine away. First surprise: the machine actually made it through the install process. Second surprise: it stayed up.</p>

<p>The only restarts since that time have been deliberate -- to upgrade Linux, or just because I feel like it&#039;s a good idea to restart once or twice a year. (Okay, a couple restarts were the result of power failures, but now it&#039;s on UPS.)</p>

<p>Lesson learned. It&#039;s not necessarily the hardware. In fact, my impression is that Apple&#039;s hardware far outshines its OS. Maybe that will change with OS X. All I ask of OS X is that be as stable as LinuxPPC and make a good server.</p>

<p><a href="http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/2000/07/19">Daniel</a>, replying to the above, writes, "All I ask of OS X it be as stable as Linux PPC, make a good server, and be as easy to admin as my current MacOS servers."</p>

<p>Excellent point. But I actually prefer Linux admin to Mac OS admin. Compare adding a virtual host using the WebSTAR Admin program to editing Apache&#039;s configuration file in emacs. Maybe I&#039;m perverse, or just weird, but I&#039;d rather edit the damn text file. It&#039;s quicker, and I know it&#039;s right.</p>

<p>Or, maybe I have to do a few things -- some DNS admin, some HTTP server admin, etc. -- it&#039;s so much easier from the command line than launching first one GUI admin app, then another, maybe having to launch remote control software, maybe not. It&#039;s just too much screwing around when I could be typing.</p>

<p>That said, what I really prefer is browser-based admin. If I could have one place to go to do everything -- that would be a dream. Check out the Cobalt Qube.
