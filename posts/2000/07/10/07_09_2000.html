<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/entertainment/newsid_825000/825641.stm">Blade Runner riddle solved</a>. No! That&#039;s just so completely and tragically wrong. Listen. Having Rick Deckard be a replicant is clever and ironic, sure, but pretty boring. Not knowing -- and knowing that on the most important level <em>it doesn&#039;t matter</em> -- is much better.</p>

<p>And who the hell is Ridley Scott to say? Rick Deckard is Philip Dick&#039;s creation. Ridley Scott has exactly zero authority on this. Go to blazes for being such a dumb-ass.</p>

<p>Went on a Napster-induced oldies binge last night. Chiffons, Martha and the Vandellas, Gene Vincent, Little Richard, Eddie Cochran, Marvelettes, Jerry Lee Lewis, Ritchie Valens. I like to daydream about an alternate history: how would rock and roll have progressed had the British Invasion not happened?
