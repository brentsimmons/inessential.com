<p>Song of the day here at inessential HQ is Jesus Jones&#039; Right Here, Right Now.</p>

<p>The woman on the radio talks about revolution<br />
But it&#039;s already passed her by.<br />
Bob Dylan didn&#039;t have this to sing about<br />
You know it feels good to be alive.</p>

<p>I was alive and I waited, waited<br />
I was alive and I waited for this.<br />
Right here, right now<br />
There is no other place I wanna be.<br />
Right here, right now<br />
Watching the world wake up from history.</p>

<p>I saw the decade end when it seemed<br />
The world could change at the blink of an eye<br />
And if anything<br />
Then there&#039;s your sign of the times.
