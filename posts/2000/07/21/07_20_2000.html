<p>Word From The WaSP: <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/wfw/ns0700.html">For the Good of the Web: An Open Letter to Netscape</a>. "We all anticipated that Microsoft and other browser makers would be forced to emulate your support for XML and the DOM out of sheer competitiveness. But mainly, Netscape, we all expected you to release a product. And to quickly take Navigator 4, a browser that forces developers to write non-valid code, off the market."</p>
