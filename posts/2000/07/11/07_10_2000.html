<p>My iBook (and Airport station, card, extra memory) came this morning. I&#039;m still excited -- I don&#039;t have it all set up yet, but I&#039;m looking forward to working outside.</p>

<p>There&#039;s an aspect aside from just the wireless, portability thing -- I feel very keenly the weight of all the towers and giant monitors and industrial-strength furniture required to support computers. It&#039;s as if we live on the surface of Jupiter. In the future, people will look back on this era as a kind of &#039;50s era. The &#039;50s: cars were huge, X-Rays were poisonous, and housewives took horse tranquilizers for their nerves. The early &#039;00s: computers were heavy and stationary, monitors were as big and heavy as vacuum-tube TVs. We&#039;re transitioning away from the gigantic-ness of computers. I hope.</p>

<p>Perhaps I&#039;m over-sensitive, but all this plastic and metal and glass has always seemed like so much unneccesary ballast.</p>

<p>If you&#039;re old enough, do you remember before you had a computer? We don&#039;t actually need this big appliance (or several of them) to anchor us to the ground, we&#039;ll do fine, we&#039;ll do better, with the small and light.</p>

<p>I hate when I can&#039;t find something on Napster. Looking for Julee Cruise&#039;s cover of "Summer Kisses Winter Tears." Which I actually have on a CD around here, but I want to add it to my Napster playlist. Nuts.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> I discovered that the Napster servers aren&#039;t connected together. So if you disconnect, then reconnect, you might find things you couldn&#039;t find before, because you&#039;ll be on a different Napster server. The above is a case in point -- I searched again, couldn&#039;t find it, disconnected, reconnected, found it.</p>

<p>Is every made-for-TV movie about people getting terribly sick and then having an angel come rescue them? Watching ads on TV gave me the chance to utter this negative-creep-sounding line: "I hate miracles." Sheila suspects people will start getting sick on purpose just so they can have a heart-warming experience as seen on TV.</p>

<p>Speaking of TV. What part of "this is a clich√©d joke that wasn&#039;t even funny the first time" don&#039;t you understand?</p>

<p>Here&#039;s something I&#039;m glad about on TV -- we appear to be coming to the end of those commercials whose slogans always have the form of philosophical pronouncement followed by a command. You know what I mean: "Life is muddy. Wallow in it." Ugh, finally, at last, we&#039;re seeing less of this.
