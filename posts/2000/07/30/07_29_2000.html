<p>Testing the Manila site editing features in Radio UserLand/Mac. Hello, is this thing on?</p>

<p>If you can read this, that&#039;s a good sign.</p>

<p>It&#039;s <a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/2000/07/30">Howard Jones Day</a> on Sheila&#039;s site. Remember him? Howard says: "Now you can have a page or site and share it with the world. It could revolutionize the media and the music business as we know it and as a matter of fact I hope it does."</p>

<p>Whenever I have the urge to add a <a href="http://audrey.editthispage.com/2000/07/30">drop-shadow</a> or some 3-D effect to a web page I remember that edict from the &#039;50s art world: thou shalt not violate the integrity of the picture plane.</p>

<p>I&#039;ve heard that the Soviets used to have fake American towns where they would train agents for deep cover operations in America. You&#039;d live there, think American, speak English, eat hot dogs, watch television, until you&#039;re indistinguishable from someone born and raised in the States.</p>

<p>Then you&#039;d be placed in America. At some point in the future, you&#039;d receive an activation signal.</p>

<p>I sometimes wonder if my life would be any different had I been raised in such a town rather than being an American, Chicago-born.</p>

<p>No, I don&#039;t think it would be any different. Except, in the back of my mind, I&#039;d sometimes think -- my control signal hasn&#039;t come. No signal yet.</p>

<p>By the way, in general terms, that&#039;s the premise of Kurt Vonnegut&#039;s Mother Night: you are what you appear to be. One of my favorite Vonnegut books. (Others being Sirens of Titan, Slaughterhouse Five, and Bluebeard.)
