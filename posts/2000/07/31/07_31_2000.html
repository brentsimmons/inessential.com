<p>I&#039;m on vacation this week. I slept in &#039;til noon! Heavenly. I don&#039;t know if being on vacation means I&#039;ll update my weblog more than normal or less.</p>

<p>Habits are habits. First thing I did after making coffee was read Scripting News. It&#039;s like reading the morning newspaper. Gotta do it, or the day doesn&#039;t feel right.
