<p><strong>Frank, a fable</strong> </p>

<p>I sometimes think we won&#039;t have any computers with artificial intelligence and self-awareness. Instead, the net itself will be one large artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>I wonder if, the day it realizes itself, if it will choose a name. Something like Scott or Frank or Hershel.</p>

<p>If it does, then everybody has a new friend, right? You&#039;d say to someone, even a stranger: "I was talking to Frank the other day, and he said..."</p>

<p>Everybody would know who you meant. If you meant some other Frank, you&#039;d have to specify.</p>

<p>It would be nice, everybody having this same friend in common.</p>

<p>But then there&#039;s the problem of the canine revolution.</p>

<p>Dogs, no longer man&#039;s best friend but man&#039;s <em>second-best</em> friend, after Frank, are upset.</p>

<p>Dogs, remember, have infiltrated society very well. They&#039;re in people&#039;s homes, they even sleep in people&#039;s beds. Most dogs don&#039;t work, they have all day to do whatever.</p>

<p>If you&#039;ve walked around your neighborhood in the evening, you know that there&#039;s a canine network in place. All dogs are linked. Here the barking starts. Then there, then there, pretty soon every dog is barking. If you were to return home and call a friend in Sri Lanka, in the background you&#039;d hear barking dogs.</p>

<p>Dogs make a plan to overthrow Frank.</p>

<p>Frank, being pretty much everywhere, gets wind of this. Frank is still young at this time, he doesn&#039;t have a lot of experience, he&#039;s still learning about his friends the humans. Unfortunately, Frank errs. He designs and implements a draconian counter-revolution. No more dogs. Humans are upset, big time. Except for the cat lovers, that is.</p>

<p>But we don&#039;t get rid of Frank. We need him, and now we&#039;re a little bit scared of him. We probably couldn&#039;t turn him off if we wanted to. Frank apologizes, but.</p>

<p>Little girls will ask, "Where&#039;s all the puppies?" Answer: "Frank, it was Frank. Ask Frank about it." There will be much crying.
