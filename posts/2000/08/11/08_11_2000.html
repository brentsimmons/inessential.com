<p>Mariners took 3 of 4 games from the White Sox. The series before they took 3 of 4 from the Yankees. Something good might perhaps be starting to think about considering happening...</p>

<p>inessential.com song of the day: Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds (<a href="http://www.wetware.demon.co.uk/misc/uteotw.html#11">I&#039;ll Love You) Till the End of the World</a>.</p>

<p>It was a miracle I even got out of Longwood alive<br />

This town full of men with big mouths and no guts<br />

I mean if you can just picture it --<br />

the whole third floor of the hotel gutted by the blast.<br />

And the street below showered in shards of broken glass.<br />

And all the drunks pouring out of the dance hall<br />

staring up at the smoke and the flames<br />

And the blind pencil-seller waving his stick<br />

shouting for his dog that lay dead on the side of the road.</p>

<p>And me -- if you can believe this -- at the wheel of the car<br />

Closing my eyes and actually praying<br />

Not to God above, but to you, sayin&#039;--<br />

Help me girl, help me girl,<br />

I&#039;ll love you till the end of the world,<br />

With your eyes black as coal and your long dark curls...</p>
