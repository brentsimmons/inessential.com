<p>I&#039;d heard that Napster was written in C. If so, how do they do Web browser control embedding?</p>

<p>I fired up Spy++ to see if I could learn anything about it. I see a class AtlAxWin.</p>

<p>Damn -- they&#039;re using ATL, which is C++ only. Browser embedding is easy stuff in ATL; ATL is designed for making COM easy. (That&#039;s not to knock the Napster folks -- but rather to say they made a good choice.)</p>
