<p><a href="http://radio.userland.com/editmanilasites.html">How to Edit Manila Sites</a> in Radio UserLand.</p>

<p>Do you edit your site with Radio UserLand? Here&#039;s a badge you can display. If your site is on a UserLand server, just type "radioBadge".</p>

<p>"radioBadge"</p>

<p>Here&#039;s how I&#039;m using the new feature, at least for now. I keep an outline with just my Manila sites. It&#039;s stored at workspace.manilaSites. I made this outline a bookmark via the Bookmarks menu. I also assigned Cmd-M to this menu item. So, whenever I want my outline of Manila sites to appear, I type Cmd-M, and there it is. (M is for Manila, naturally.)
