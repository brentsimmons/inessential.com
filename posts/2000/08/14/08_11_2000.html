<p>A few days ago we added QuickTime support to Radio UserLand. From that, a couple tips for anyone adding QuickTime support to an application. These were a couple of stumpers.</p>

<p>1. The movie controller wouldn&#039;t show up. There was a blank white space where it was supposed to be. The fix: call MCIdle each pass through the event loop. Calling MoviesTask did not do the trick.</p>

<p>2. You&#039;re going to crash when calling MCSetActionFilterWithRefCon. Unless you do it this way: </p>

<p><code>MCSetActionFilterWithRefCon (myController, NewMCActionFilterWithRefConProc(myFilter), (long) myPlayerWindow);</code>
</p>
