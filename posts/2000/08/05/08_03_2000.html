<p>From the <a href="http://www.killrockstars.com/about/">history of Kill Rock Stars</a>, an independent record label in Olympia, WA:</p>

<p>"Major labels exist for one reason and one reason only: profit. Nowadays there are plenty of &#039;independent&#039; and pseudo-independent labels (how come all these labels that are half-owned by majors or distributed by major-owned distributors still try to claim to be &#039;indie&#039;?) who exist purely for the profit-motive, but the good independent labels continue to put out records for the right reasons: the love of music and tons of respect for the people that make the music. Major labels do not treat bands with respect, unless they are &#039;stars&#039;. Bands are just a commodity to major labels, and so are the fans who buy the records, just a &#039;demographic&#039; and a &#039;market&#039;."</p>
