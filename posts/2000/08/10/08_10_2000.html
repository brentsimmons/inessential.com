<p>Stop everything! It&#039;s aliens! They&#039;re here!</p>

<p>Oh no, wait, false alarm.</p>

<p>Yesterday I predicted a Mariners win. But no -- <a href="http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com/u/ce/recap/0,2405,MLB_20000809_SEA@CHW,00.htm">they got creamed</a>! 19-3. White Sox blew them away as if they were a pack of school kids.</p>

<p>If the M&#039;s lose today, they split the series. Which is respectable against the team with the best record in the AL. I&#039;d rather they win -- but I&#039;m not going to predict it. Not again.</p>
