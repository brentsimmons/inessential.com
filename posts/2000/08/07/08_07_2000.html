<p>I&#039;m debating getting a latte. (Double-short iced.) Lattes contain milk, the devil&#039;s drink. It&#039;s a gamble. I could go to hell.</p>

<p>Because I&#039;m truly a geek, I guess, or truly obsessed, or just weird or ill-adjusted or something, over my vacation I checked out <a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macos8/MultimediaGraphics/RenderingLibrary/renderinglibrary.html">Apple&#039;s HTML rendering library</a>.</p>

<p>It appears to be easy to embed, doesn&#039;t require C++ or any weird frameworks (like Microsoft&#039;s stuff does). The <a href="http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/Sample_Code/Human_Interface_Toolbox/HTMLSample.htm">sample code</a> looked quite straightforward.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it&#039;s weak. It has no built-in TCP functionality -- it only renders local files or buffers. If you click on an http link, it opens in your default browser.</p>

<p>It supports HTML 3.2, not HTML 4 or 4.0.1. It appears not to support CSS or JavaScript. (Correct me if I&#039;m wrong. The docs aren&#039;t very specific about the limitations.)</p>

<p>You can&#039;t select text -- the HTML rendering is more like an image than text.</p>

<p>I&#039;m back from vacation. It was great! Now back to work...</p>

<p>inessential.com song of the day: They Might Be Giants "Istanbul (not Constantinople)."</p>

<p>Istanbul was Constantinople<br />
Now it&#039;s Istanbul not Constantinople<br />
Been a long time gone<br />
Constantinople<br />
Now a Turkish delight<br />
on a moonlit night</p>

<p>Every gal in Constantinople<br />
lives in Istanbul not Constantinople<br />
So if you have a date<br />
in Constantinople<br />
She&#039;ll be waiting in Istanbul<br /></p>

<p>Even old New York was once New Amsterdam<br />
Why&#039;d they change it I can&#039;t say --<br />
people just liked it better that way...
