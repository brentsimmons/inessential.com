<p>Another day of using Radio UserLand to edit my home page -- look Ma, no Pike button.</p>

<p>To recap -- I&#039;m working on adding Manila sites as a node type in Radio UserLand. When you expand a site, you can edit the home page, messages, various templates, etc. just by double-clicking. Everything is bookmarkable and re-organizable.</p>

<p>Where I am right now: finishing up the discussion group browser. Then moving on to a site structure editor. (Right-click to set attributes such as message number.)</p>

<p>In the meantime, the <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$19928">tunes are playing</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s an observation only a geek could make. The Manila sites outline feels -- to me -- like the project files window in Metrowerks CodeWarrior. It&#039;s tall and narrow. I have it on the right side of my screen. When I want to edit something, I double-click over there. Radio UserLand is an IDE for websites?
