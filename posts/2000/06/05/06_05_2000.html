<p>Jake&#039;s got a question for <a href="http://jake.editthispage.com/">Mozilla gurus</a>.</p>

<p>Discuss.UserLand.Com: <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$17583">A discussion about Themes</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.joecartoon.com/new/joefish.html">joefish</a> is totally funny. Requires Flash. (Rated PG-13 for language and animated violence -- but it&#039;s still totally funny.) Via Melissa -- who doesn&#039;t have a weblog, but should.</p>

<p>Themes are coming, soon. (Not sure what day yet.) There are a few technical details still to work out, a little UI left to do, but the hard parts have been done.</p>

<p>If you think you might want to make Manila themes, there a couple things you can do to prepare. One is create a site that you want to make clone-able. Maybe that&#039;s your existing site -- if not, go to <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/iWantOne">Weblogs.Com</a> and create a new site. After making a site that you think would be a cool theme, validate the HTML and CSS. I posted a <a href="http://inessential.com/2000/06/01.html">couple bookmarklets</a> the other day that help with validation.</p>

<p>You don&#039;t have to shoot for HTML 4.0.1 Strict -- given the state of browsers, HTML 4.0.1 Transitional is a good level.</p>

<p>I could write a little essay here about why standards are important, but I&#039;d rather work on getting themes finished. Instead I&#039;ll point you to the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">Web Standards Project</a>.</p>

<p>More about themes will appear as we release the feature.</p>

<p>(Yes, this site still doesn&#039;t validate. It will once I have time. Themes are the priority.)</p>

<p>"White youth, black youth, better find another solution. Why not phone up Robin Hood, and ask him for some wealth distribution." Listening to The Clash <a href="http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?WRK=3225723">From Here to Eternity</a>, their live album released last year. Ya sure, it rocks.</p>

<p>Seems like lots of people are setting up radio stations with <a href="http://www.live365.com/home/index.html">Live365.com</a> -- maybe it&#039;s time for Radio Free Ballard. You betcha.</p>

<p>I figured out how to do a HotSync with my Visor last night. It took about 10 minutes, and a couple restarts, but probably only because I didn&#039;t read any of the instructions.</p>

<p>I installed <a href="http://www.aportis.com/tryme/download/BrainForest/brainforestmobile.html">BrainForest</a>, because I wanted an outliner. I&#039;ll write a review after using it for a few days.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> Tom Donovan <a href="http://editorial.inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$651">loves BrainForest</a>. Tom has posted some converters for going from Frontier to BrainForest and back.</p>

<p><em>As I was mowing the lawn -- with my mechanical push mower, human-powered, software-developer-powered -- a blister formed on the edge of my right hand, the karate-chop outer edge. I had to hold the handle of the mower the way some baseball players hold their bats, with the pinky finger off the knob end, wrapped around thin air.</em></p>

<p>There are people, probably most people, for whom likenesses -- similarities, similes, metaphors, connections -- come easily and unasked-for. This promotes a richness of experience, as one runs strings connecting this to that, as daily life becomes web-like.</p>

<p>But there&#039;s a mushiness to this, too -- we experience life as metaphor soup. Rather than seeing something for what it actually is, we see what&#039;s related. </p>

<p>Sometimes I think what Zen is (or part of what Zen is, or a side effect of Zen) is a complete lack of metaphor. Precision of observation; un-self-conscious focus of experience. Admittedly I know very little about Zen, other than what a <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0375705090">couple</a> <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0465026567">books</a> have said.</p>

<p>Two Zen principles have always meant a lot to me yet remain mysterious:</p>

<p>1. Zen is your everday life.</p>

<p>2. The uninitiated sees a blade of grass as a blade of grass. The Zen student sees a blade of grass as... something else, something so much more than a blade of grass. The Zen master sees a blade of grass... as a blade of grass.</p>

<p><img src="/images/atom.gif" height="30" width="29" border="0" alt="" /></p>

<p>It&#039;s been said the Zen is incompatible with Western forms of art. (The Beats, perhaps intending to disprove that thesis, ended up strengthening that position.)</p>

<p>A book I started reading (I&#039;m about a third of the way through) makes me question that. It&#039;s <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0156627809">Mr. Palomar</a> by Italo Calvino.</p>

<p>Mr. Palomar is an observer of phenomena. (<a href="http://astro.caltech.edu/palomarpublic/">Duh</a>.) The book opens with him watching waves on a beach. The descriptions of vague, chaotic patterns are rendered with precision, with very little metaphor. I&#039;m not even finished the book, and I can already tell you it&#039;s worth reading. It&#039;s making me think about the way I experience the world.</p>

<p>Boy, I really like cream soda.
