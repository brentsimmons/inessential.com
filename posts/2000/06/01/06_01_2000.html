<p>John VanDyk: <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$4246">Announcing the Metadata Plugin for Manila</a>: "This plugin allows the association of arbitrary metadata with stories in a Manila site. Metadata can be indexed automatically and macros can use these indices to build tables of contents, keyword search results, product summaries, or whatever you can dream up."</p>

<p>I like how Daniel Berlinger <a href="http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/discuss/">has used</a> the Discuss CSS feature -- the header is a background image, a gradient. Looks good. <em>Super-bon.</em></p>

<p>Bookmarklet for validating HTML below. It validates the HTML in the page you&#039;re looking at using W3C&#039;s on-line validator.</p>

<p>It&#039;s been tested in MSIE 5 Windows and Macintosh on my machines. To install, drag the link to your Toolbar Favorites or ctrl-click (or right-click) on it and add it to your Favorites.</p>

<p><a href="javascript: var url = &#039;http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=&#039;; var currentUrl = document.location.href; url = url + escape (currentUrl); document.location.href = url; &#039;Validating HTML: &#039; + currentUrl + &#039;...&#039;">Validate HTML</a></p>

<p>Here&#039;s one for validating CSS:</p>

<p><a href="javascript: var url = &#039;http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=&#039;; var currentUrl = document.location.href; url = url + escape (currentUrl); document.location.href = url; &#039;Validating CSS: &#039; + currentUrl + &#039;...&#039;">Validate CSS</a></p>

<p>You&#039;ll note that this page doesn&#039;t validate -- that will change.</p>

<p><a href="http://velocity.editthispage.com/">Velocity</a>: Michael&#039;s writing about teenagers partying at the Seattle Center. It warms my heart: there&#039;s a sense of continuity here. 15 years ago that was me, that was my friends. Of course -- in those days the Center hadn&#039;t been renovated yet, and Skoochie&#039;s was nearby. Do kids these days have as much fun as we had? I hope so. (The responsible adult in me adds: we always took the bus.)</p>

<p>Avoiding fights was always interesting, at least back in the &#039;80s. "New Wavers suck!" My witty reply: "Stoners suck!" Ah, the good old days.</p>

<p>I started using my new Handspring Visor yesterday. So far so good -- in fact, it&#039;s great. Pretty much all the time I need to work very systematically: so I create a short-term to-do list (but as a memo) and keep track of where I am. It&#039;s hard to do in a desktop app, because often my screen is full of windows I&#039;m working on, no room for another app or outline. Or I may be doing something that requires me to quit and restart Frontier or Pike often (say a new build), and I can&#039;t keep an outline open.</p>

<p>The other thing I&#039;m finding it&#039;s good for is to take random notes of things I discover. For instance, last night I was validating the HTML and CSS on a website, and discovered that the spacePixels macro leaves out the alt attribute, thereby creating non-valid HTML. I no longer trust my memory on these things, I like to make notes.</p>

<p>I haven&#039;t learned to do a HotSync yet. Maybe tonight. That way I can install <a href="http://www.aportis.com/products/BrainForest/benefits.html">BrainForest</a> so I can have an outliner on my Visor. My ultimate goal is connecting my PDA to the web.</p>

<p>I always think I don&#039;t like <a href="http://www.bobmarley.com/">Bob Marley and the Wailers</a>. You know: blech to that reggae stuff, it&#039;s just ska gone bad, all self-consciously political and self-righteous, and slow and boring, blah blah blah -- but then I actually hear a Bob Marley <a href="http://www.bobmarley.com/songs/songs.cgi?couldyou">song</a>, and I think: wow, that&#039;s good. What an artist, what a band.
