<p>Reminder: Tuesday night is <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/06/12">Scripting News dinner night</a> in Seattle, 7 p.m., at Mama&#039;s Mexican Kitchen in Belltown.</p>

<p>If we&#039;re real good, maybe after dinner we&#039;ll go mobile, take a short walk to the <a href="http://www.eastsideweek.com/features/9939/belly-stusser.shtml">Frontier Room</a>.</p>

<p>Sheila&#039;s got <a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/2000/06/12">the scoop on squirrels</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.biermania.com/">Biermania</a>! Bob&#039;s working on the Linux port of Frontier; this is his weblog.</p>

<p>I got a haircut today at the local barber shop, always a very <a href="http://www.lewisbond.com/rckwellpgs/psters/first_haircut.html">Norman Rockwell</a> experience. He actually did have lollipops, but he didn&#039;t offer me one. Well, that&#039;s okay.</p>

<p>I always feel smarter after getting a haircut. I also feel like I look <em>fierce</em> -- another illusion.</p>

<p>My barber has an actual <a href="http://www.barberpole.com/">barber pole</a>. If you don&#039;t already know it, the <a href="http://www.barberpole.com/history.htm">history of the barber pole</a> might be surprising (and a little gruesome).</p>

<p>Lawrence Lee applied the MinimalWhite Theme to <a href="http://tomalak.weblogs.com/">tomalak.weblogs.com</a> -- then started personalizing it, changing colors, etc. It looks great! Lawrence writes: "This should be a popular starting point for new Manila users."</p>

<p>I&#039;m glad to see someone using MinimalWhite. (This is the first instance that I know of.) My personal favorite so far, it&#039;s designed to bring the words to the front, to get everything else out of the way.</p>

<p>Also: it&#039;s a reminder that when you apply a Theme you don&#039;t have to stop there. Themes can be starting points, as Lawrence writes and shows by example.</p>

<p>How did I find out about it? I went to <a href="http://themes.userland.com/">Themes.UserLand.Com</a>, where Lawrence created a News Item. Members can create News Items, you don&#039;t have to be an editor. So if you create a Theme, or are using a Theme, or have something to say about Themes, that&#039;s the place to go.</p>

<p><a href="http://latte.weblogs.com/2000/06/12">Latte.Weblogs.Com</a>: "BTW, I really like the new theme feature. I&#039;ve tried to muck about with web page design but I&#039;m not a graphic designer and I never will be. These themes allow design-newbies like me to have a cool web site."</p>

<p>I pointed to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/10/31/specials/calvino.html">Celebrating Italo Calvino</a> NY Times audio special <a href="http://inessential.com/1999/11/09.html">last November</a>, and last night I finally got around to starting to listen to it. I didn&#039;t get much past the opening (yet) -- Calvino&#039;s daughter, Giovanna Calvino, so touched by the recognition her father still receives years after his death, can&#039;t make it through the opening remarks without starting to cry.</p>

<p>Is it too much to talk about "loving" a writer you&#039;ve never met and never can meet? Yes. Duh. But then there&#039;s no word for the bond, however one-way, that exists between a passionate reader and the mind of the author whose works incite that passion.</p>

<p>Between the lines, behind the words, one perceives -- partly, inaccurately, with not a little bit of projection at work -- a style of consciousness, a mental cosmos that&#039;s immensely attractive. It&#039;s a fiction, to be sure, one in which the reader plays a large role. But: there is (was) a real mind behind it.
