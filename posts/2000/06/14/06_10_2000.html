<p>Thanks to everyone who came to the Scripting News dinner last night! I had a great time.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s <a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/2000/06/14">Sheila</a>, <a href="http://zopefish.weblogs.com/2000/06/14">David Brown</a>, <a href="http://surprise.editthispage.com/2000/06/14">Mira</a>, and <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/06/14">Dave</a> on the Scripting News dinner.</p>

<p>I&#039;m imagining Bill Gates at home singing along to his karaoke machine. (He&#039;s rich; undoubtedly he has a karaoke machine.) The song is a Clash cover of an old favorite. Bill sings:
<blockquote>
<pre>Breaking rocks in the hot sun
I fought the law and the law won.
I needed money &#039;cause I had none
I fought the law and the law won.
I killed my baby and I feel so sad --
I guess my race is run.
She&#039;s the best baby that I ever had --
I fought the law and the law won.
I fought the law and the -- the law won.</pre>
</blockquote>
His "baby" is of course Microsoft.</p>

<p>Does Bill sound like himself as he&#039;s singing, or is he trying to sing like Joe Strummer? He&#039;s all alone: I think he&#039;s trying to sing like Joe Strummer. He sounds like he needs to clear his throat.</p>

<p>If I can leave you with one final detail to sort of bring the image on home: Bill&#039;s taken off his glasses and tied a red-and-white bandanna around his head, a la Axl Rose.
