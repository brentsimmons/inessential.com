<p>Themes are now available on Weblogs.Com and EditThisPage.Com sites. If you run your own server, update manila.root to get the new feature.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://rightstrip.weblogs.com/">New Theme</a> available now on EditThisPage.Com and Weblogs.Com servers.</p>

<p>We&#039;re shipping just a few Themes at first -- we want to stress that Themes are a wide open area, there&#039;s lots of room and opportunity for creativity. You don&#039;t need Frontier to create Themes, all you need is a Manila site. Here are the first four shipping Themes: <a href="http://default.weblogs.com/">Default</a>, <a href="http://olddays.weblogs.com/">OldDays</a>, <a href="http://thicklines.weblogs.com/">ThickLines</a>, and <a href="http://stripes.weblogs.com/">Stripes</a>. Will there be more? You bet.</p>

<p>New Themes-related macros: <a href="http://macros.userland.com/basic/homePageLink">homePageLink</a>, <a href="http://macros.userland.com/basic/themeLink">themeLink</a>, <a href="http://macros.userland.com/basic/downloadTheme">downloadTheme</a>.</p>

<p>As I was working on shipping Themes last night I had a local talk radio station on in the background. There were discussing the Microsoft breakup order.</p>

<p>Overwhelmingly, the callers were upset, disagreeing sometimes vehemently with the decision. And, also overwhelmingly, they weren&#039;t software industry people, but people with a PC at home who browse the web, send email, write in Word, and so on. The common theme: Bill Gates is great, he&#039;s made all this so easy and convenient and cheap.</p>

<p>There were a few dissenters, but none of them could coherently explain why a Microsoft monopoly hurts customers.</p>

<p>After I got over my emotional thinking -- I just wanted to shake some sense into people who I thought were grievously and sadly deluded -- I remembered that these people are right, maybe not about Microsoft itself (they gave Bill Gates personal credit for pretty much everything good in the world of computing, often absurdly) -- but they&#039;re absolutely right about what they want from computers. And they&#039;re right that Microsoft, in conjunction with HP, Compaq, Dell, etc., offers it to them, and no one else does.</p>

<p>I don&#039;t offer a conclusion or lesson, just a report.</p>

<p>There&#039;s another view: the Microsoft case is just another example of this stupid, unnamed syndrome that&#039;s been going on as long as I can remember -- we can&#039;t seem to last two minutes without there being a major news story that drags out, usually in the courts, for months and years.</p>

<p>From Iran-Contra to the Gulf War to Rodney King to Tonya Harding to O. J. Simpson to Monica Lewinsky to Elian Gonzalez to Bill Gates. It&#039;s so tiring. A part of me favors injustice over the dreariness of these stories. Usually we get both injustice and intense boredom. Can&#039;t we skip straight to the injustice, bypass the months and years of wondering when this thing will ever end? I&#039;m being facetious, but you get my point.
