<p><a href="http://seattle.sidewalk.citysearch.com/E/V/SEAWA/0006/69/06/">Mama&#039;s Mexican Kitchen</a> will be the location of the <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/06/07">Scripting News dinner</a> Tuesday at 7 p.m. We&#039;ve got a private room. I made reservations for 20. (Under my name: Brent Simmons.)</p>

<p>If you&#039;re planning to attend, <a href="http://surveys.userland.com/surveys/run/dave@userland.com/areYouComing">take the survey</a> . I&#039;d like to get a more clear idea of the number of diners, in case the reservation needs to be modified. Thanks!</p>

<p>John VanDyk <a href="http://vfih.editthispage.com/2000/06/07">writes</a> of eating Marshmallow Safari for breakfast, of how American supermarkets devote an entire aisle to breakfast cereal. As an adult I lost the ability to digest milk, and every time I go to the grocery store I hear the call of my beloved <a href="http://www.kraftfoods.com/postcereals/gc.html">Post Golden Crisp</a>. How I miss the smiling and contented face of Sugar Bear in the morning. Sugar Bear, man, you rock.</p>

<p>It&#039;s just milk I have a problem with. Bring on the garlic and jalapenos. I like them <a href="http://spicynoodles.com/">spicy noodles</a>.</p>

<p>Actually it&#039;s not just milk. Another common household substance -- marijuana -- nauseates me. In my personal reality milk and marijuana are linked, are brothers in the same family of stuff that sends me to the WC. Which is probably a good thing, otherwise I&#039;d be a total stoner, working the late shift at a video store.</p>

<p>So as not to shatter my already cracked street cred, let&#039;s say, without going into details, that in my very distant past I tried a number of other drugs and found them copascetic. Also note: I don&#039;t endorse or condone the use of drugs. I don&#039;t condemn it, either, I&#039;m in the enviable position of being completely apathetic on the subject. (Well, that was the sound of my street cred shattering, as jagged, reflective shards hit the pavement.) Protestant by upbringing, if not by practice, I condone hard work, physical and mental exercise, and put my faith in the four food groups, despite the special challenges the dairy group presents me.</p>

<p>It&#039;s a good day when you can go from Sugar Bear to Flow-bear in a few paragraphs.
