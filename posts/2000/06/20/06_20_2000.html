<p>Did you hear about Louis Miller?<br />
He disappeared, babe,<br />
after drawin&#039; out all his cash.<br />
Now Macheath spends like a sailor,<br />
did our boy do -- something rash?</p>

<p>Got Napster last night, listened to various versions of Mack the Knife: Bobby Darin, Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, Ella Fitzgerald, Nick Cave, Tony Bennet. (I tried but failed to download the Louis Armstrong version.)</p>

<p>Taking an example from Dave, I downloaded my personal favorite Bob Dylan song: "Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again."</p>

<p>Well the bricks lay on Grand Street<br />
where the neon madmen climb.<br />
They&#039;re all placed there so perfectly,<br />
they all seem so well-timed.<br />
But me I sit hear patiently, <br />
waiting to find out what price<br />
you have to pay to get out of<br />
going through all these things twice.</p>

<p>Has this Greenwich Village poet been reading Nietzsche? (It&#039;s Nietzsche, right, that eternal return stuff?)</p>

<p>But anyway, I dig the poetry of this song. Less wise, more surreal, than Subterranean Homesick Blues, but full of compelling imagery.</p>

<p>Of course, part of my fondness is nostalgia: as a boy in the early &#039;80s I had most of Dylan&#039;s &#039;60s albums on vinyl and cassette. Highway 61 Revisited, all that.</p>

<p>I remember sitting alone in my room at night, listening to Dylan through the headphones, reading On the Road, thinking -- everything sucks, the system sucks, adults suck, school sucks, but Dylan understands. This was the Reagan era, morning in America, a good time to hate the world adults had created. Good clean fun, part of a healthy upbringing. You&#039;re never too young to start using the f word. (F is for fascist.)</p>

<p>Back to Mack the Knife, more nostalgia: when I was in college I sometimes claimed -- in jest, as conversation -- that I was the re-incarnation of Bertolt Brecht, born again as, horror of horrors, a capitalist American pig. I even wore a Brecht-like hat.</p>

<p>Oh the shark has such teeth dear,<br />
and he shows them -- pearly white.<br />
Just a jack knife has Macheath dear,<br />
and he keeps it out of sight.</p>

<p>When the shark bites with his teeth dear,<br />
scarlet billows, starts to spread.<br />
Fancy gloves though, wears Macheath dear --<br />
so there&#039;s not a trace of red.</p>

<p>Napster should probably be classified as a drug. It&#039;s one thing to have all these memories and associations tied up with music -- and quite another to be able to access them all whenever you want.
