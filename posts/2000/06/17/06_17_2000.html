<p>You&#039;ve heard of "damning with faint praise," right -- when someone who, for instance, thinks the Mona Lisa sucks, they say something like "DaVinci&#039;s choice of color was appropriate for the subject matter."</p>

<p>There&#039;s also such a thing as "praising with faint damns." Usually that&#039;s what you do when talking about your own stuff.</p>

<p>Jane says: "Jim, I really like your [painting, novel, song, whatever]!"</p>

<p>Jim says: "Thanks Jane, that means alot to me. But I was frustrated at not being able to achieve [super-impressive sounding] effect right here."</p>

<p>Watch for it: you&#039;ll notice this all the time.</p>

<p>Yes, thank you, I&#039;m glad you like my weblog, but I&#039;m frustrated at not being able to insert a witty quip right here.</p>

<p>Continuing a thread from <a href="http://inessential.com/2000/06/16.html">yesterday</a>, more slow things Americans do:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.golf.com/">Golf</a>. <a href="http://www.golf.com/">Fishing</a>. <a href="http://www.garden.com/">Gardening</a>.</p>

<p>Gardening is huge. More than <a href="http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com/">baseball</a>, gardening is the nation&#039;s past-time.</p>

<p>We also read alot of <a href="http://bn.com/">books</a>. Books are big.</p>

<p>I&#039;m tempted to list <a href="http://www.nascar.com/">car racing</a> as an example of slowness. Yes, the cars themselves are moving fast, but if you watch a race you&#039;ll note that the relative positions of cars can remain static for long periods of time. It&#039;s <a href="http://users.utu.fi/hansalmi/wagner.spml">Wagnerian</a>. Glacial. Like baseball, an hour can go by where nothing happens.</p>

<p>When the history of sitcoms in the &#039;90s is written, it will record that <a href="http://epguides.com/NewsRadio/guide.shtml">NewsRadio</a>, not <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/4415/index.html">Seinfeld</a>, was funniest.
