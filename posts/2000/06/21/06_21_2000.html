<p>The <a href="http://coolblue.weblogs.com/">CoolBlue Theme</a> is new. It&#039;s available on EditThisPage.Com and Weblogs.Com sites and for download.</p>

<p>Bob has a question for <a href="http://www.biermania.com/2000/06/21">Linux</a> folks about Wine debugging and symbol names.</p>

<p>I&#039;d like a map of the 20th century in a Web page. It would be a chronological list of years. Under each year would be entries for the important events in art, literature, music, history, and technology.</p>

<p>There would be plenty of links off-site -- you&#039;d follow a link to learn more about the Armory Show, about the moon landing, whatever. Call it historical weblogging.</p>

<p>At first I thought an index at the bottom would be needed, but now I don&#039;t think so -- browsers have a Find command which works well enough.
