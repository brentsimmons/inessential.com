<p>I&#039;m going to the <a href="http://www.loureed.org/">Lou Reed</a> show tonight. Years ago I made up a song: I Wanna Be Lou Reed. It&#039;s still true. If you&#039;re roughly my age (early 30s) there&#039;s a strong chance you think that the Velvet Underground invented music. You&#039;ve noticed that "icon" is an anagram for Nico. When people mention The White Album, you think of VU&#039;s white album with the <a href="http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?ean=731453125025">big yellow banana</a> on the cover.</p>

<p><a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/2000/06/02">Sheila</a>&#039;s got more about Lou Reed -- and about the long-awaited return of Jamie Moyer to Seattle&#039;s starting rotation.
