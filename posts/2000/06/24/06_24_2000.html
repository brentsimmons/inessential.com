<p>Journal of a Wannabe Hipster: <a href="http://ari.editthispage.com/2000/06/24">Race, and apathy</a>: "But how can I figure race out if I don&#039;t write about it?" I want to say how much I&#039;ve been enjoying this site, or kind of sum up how Ari&#039;s writing is good or interesting or whatever, but I can&#039;t, at least not at the moment -- but I can point to it. Check it out.</p>
