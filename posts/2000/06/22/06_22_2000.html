<p>Working on 6.2 -- we&#039;re getting close to the release. To whet your appetite, here are <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$3476">detailed kernel change notes</a> and the list of <a href="http://manila.userland.com/changes/612">changes in Manila</a> since 6.1.1. (The Manila change notes are missing some of the most recent changes. It will get updated. And, when 6.2 ships, there will be a single change notes summary page to read.)
