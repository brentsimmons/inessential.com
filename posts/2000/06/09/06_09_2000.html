<p><a href="http://columbus.editthispage.com/2000/06/08">Columbus</a>: "Wow. This themes thing is really cool. I just changed the look and feel of this site 4 times in 5 minutes." This site is using my personal favorite theme (so far), the <a href="http://rightstrip.weblogs.com/">RightStrip</a> theme.</p>

<p>I&#039;m trying to develop an aesthetic approach to watching bees. We have these lovely <a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/2000/06/04">allium</a> (alliums?), now in full spherical bloom, around which bees hover like helicopters harassing a giant purple geodesic dome. But the voice in my head insists: I know it&#039;s gonna hurt me, I know it&#039;s gonna hurt me, I know it&#039;s gonna hurt me.</p>

<p>A lesson I keep re-learning: the body has limits. (Problem is, those limits keep changing on me.) The night Themes shipped I was up until dawn. The next day, yesterday, I was in a fog all day. This reporter even took a nap, which didn&#039;t help much, or not enough. I got major sleep last night and am fresh again today, I&#039;m happy to report.</p>

<p>The day begins with Madness: "So if you&#039;re coming off the street, and you&#039;re beginning to feel the heat, well listen Buster, you better start to move your feet, to the rockin&#039;-est rock-steady beat of Madness -- One Step Beyond!"
