<p>CNET: OS Death Match: <a href="http://www.cnet.com/software/0-3709-7-1890183.html?st.sw.3709.txt.3709-7-1890183">Corel Linux vs. Mac OS 9</a>.</p>

<p>Last time I was in the Bay Area I discovered a station that played &#039;80s music -- the good stuff, Billy Idol, Madness, Thompson Twins, Culture Club, etc. Question: if you know what station I&#039;m talking about, whose call letters I don&#039;t recall, is it available on RealAudio? <em>Update:</em> Mark Ward wrote to tell me it&#039;s <a href="http://www.channel1049.com/">104.9 KLOZ</a> -- which I&#039;m now listening to via Windows Media Player. Cool. At the moment I&#039;m writing this they&#039;re playing the Cure... And now it&#039;s Soft Cell&#039;s "Tainted Love." Okay, I&#039;m happy.</p>

<p>Check out the calendar -- a new feature that&#039;s coming is CSS classes in the calendar HTML, so you can use style sheets to format your calendar.</p>
