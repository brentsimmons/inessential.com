<p><strong>Mac Manila Express Bug Fix:</strong> It looks like the mangled bookmarklet problem has been solved. First delete your current Manila Express bookmarklet. Then go <a href="http://static2.userland.com/userland/ManilaExpressIe5Mac.html">here</a>, follow the instructions. Make sure it works. Try quitting and restarting IE. Does it still work? I just need a few confirmations.</p>

<p>If it works, this means you can put it in your favorites or toolbar favorites, you don&#039;t have to put it in the Apple Menu or on the desktop. (So far it works on Sheila&#039;s Mac and on my Mac -- which means it probably works in general.) (<em>Update:</em> Al Hawkins <a href="http://editorial.inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$618">reports</a> in. Looks like we&#039;re good to go.)</p>

<p>Me, I keep it in my toolbar favorites. I like having it visible, one click away. It&#039;s even easier than on Windows, where you have to right-click then select a menu item.</p>

<p>What was the problem? It was a double-quotes vs. single-quotes issue. No big deal, easily fixable.</p>
