<p>The slumping Mariners <a href="http://www.cnnsi.com/baseball/mlb/news/2000/05/15/twins_mariners_ap/index.html">beat the Twins</a> last night 14-0. A good sign, perhaps. Let&#039;s see what happens against the Twinkies tonight.</p>

<p>I just discovered <a href="http://www.devshed.com/">DevShed</a>, which calls itself "The Open Source Web Development Site." (Maybe I&#039;m the last to discover this site?) At first glance it looks useful.</p>

<p>osOpinion: <a href="http://www.osopinion.com/Opinions/StephenVanEsch/StephenVanEsch16.html">Microsoft Gamble of a Lifetime</a>: "The Next Generation Windows Services (NGWS) hatched by the crew in Redmond promises to deliver all Windows services to a browser near you. In fact, in the long run, you likely won&#039;t be able to buy Microsoft products in stores at all. Everything will be available online."</p>

<p>I think it&#039;s great that <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a> is a UNIX-ish operating system. Totally cool. I look forward to running it on my G4. On the other hand, the more I see of Aqua the less I like it. I&#039;m seeking less cuteness, not more, on my desktops. I already can&#039;t stand the cuteness of Windows, its My this and My that. Aqua&#039;s different from the Windows desktop, yes, but on another level it&#039;s looking like more of the same. Note: Apple&#039;s marketing department probably does not have people like me in my mind. Microsoft&#039;s marketing department doesn&#039;t, surely.</p>
