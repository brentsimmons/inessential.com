<p>***MSIE 5/Mac</p>

<p>Mac MSIE 5 JavaScript question: How do you get the selected text? With MSIE 5 for Windows one calls <code>document.selection.createTextRange ()</code>. With MSIE 5/Mac, I get an error that document.selection is not an object. Support for Manila Express and for the JavaScript HTML Editor in Manila depends on being able to get the selected text.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s a feature I like about MSIE 5/Mac -- you can put "folders" in the favorites bar. <em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.aaronland.net/">artboy</a> informs me you can do the same thing with Netscape/UNIX.</p>

<p>Utterly shameful. What should have been the double-play ball that would have sent us into extra innings went right on by second-baseman Mark McLemore. Fudge.</p>

<p>So, like last night, Mariners lose in the bottom of the ninth. 4-3.</p>

<p>Edgar es muy caliente. He hit a two-run home run earlier to give the Mariners a 3-0 lead. Eeeeeeeeeeeeedgaaaaaaaaaaaaaar.</p>

<p>Mariners lost yesterday, 4-2. Jay Buhner tied the game in the top of the 9th -- but then José Mesa blew it, giving up a two-run home run to Cal Ripken in the bottom of the 9th. Nuts to José Mesa.</p>

<p>***Misc.</p>

<p>I just ordered a <a href="http://www.handspring.com/">Handspring Visor</a>. I&#039;ve never owned a PDA before. <em>Update</em>: Seth Bokelman <a href="http://techsupport.editthispage.com/2000/05/24">loves</a> his Handspring Visor.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/stories/storyReader$197">new version</a> of Archipelago was released.</p>
