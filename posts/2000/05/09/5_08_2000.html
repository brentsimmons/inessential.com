<p>I&#039;m installing fixes on UserLand servers for the client-side trojan horse bug mentioned on <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/05/09">Scripting News</a> earlier tonight.</p>

<p>These fixes are also going out through the manila.root updates process.</p>

<p>It&#039;s very important -- if you see something that looks like a bug, please post a note on the dg or send me email. Thanks!</p>

<p>Idle thoughts... Does Amazon check referers? If not, there&#039;s a good chance I could get you to buy a book, thanks to the one-click system.</p>

<p>CNNSI: <a href="http://www.cnnsi.com/baseball/mlb/al/recaps/2000/05/09/rangers_mariners/">Seattle 13, Texas 3</a>. "The Mariners gave the Rangers, who had scored 72 runs in their previous eight games, a taste of their own medicine. Seattle was 19-for-45 (.422) in the contest with three home runs and two doubles."</p>

<p>Milan Kundera, from <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0060932139">The Unbearable Lightness of Being</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote>

The fantasy of the Grand March that Franz was so intoxicated by is the

political kitsch joining leftists of all times and tendencies. The

Grand March is the splendid march on the road to brotherhood, equality, 

justice, happiness; it goes on and on, obstacles notwitstanding, for

obstacles there must be if the march is to be the Grand March....</p>

<p>What makes a leftist is not this or that theory but the ability to

integrate any theory into the kitsch called the Grand March.</blockquote></p>
