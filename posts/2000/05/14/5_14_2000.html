<p><strong>Ouch</strong></p>

<p>I went to the <a href="http://www.swedish.org/">hospital</a> last night. Around midnight I slipped on the ancient hardwood floor in the living room, and a splinter an inch long drove into the bottom of my foot.</p>

<p>It took several shots to anesthetize the area. Ouch! Needles in the bottom of the foot! Also got a tetanus shot in the arm.</p>

<p>Got home around 3 a.m. Now I&#039;m up, hobbling around, off to visit <a href="http://www.inessential.com/mjdavis/">Mom</a>. Happy Mother&#039;s Day!</p>

<p><strong>View from the Foot</strong></p>

<p>While at the hospital, before the splinter was removed, <a href="http://www.inessential.com/sheila/">Sheila</a> asked, "What if we see <a href="http://viewfromtheheart.editthispage.com/">Al Hawkins</a>?"</p>

<p>"Run away," I replied.</p>

<p>"On <em>your</em> foot?"</p>

<p>"Yes... He is in Portland, right?"</p>

<p>(This is just by way of teasing EditThisPage.Com&#039;s resident critical care nurse. Not that the conversation didn&#039;t happen, mind you.)</p>

<p>Swedish Emergency Room in Ballard was quiet and clean. Everybody was nice. Yes, there was waiting time -- but not as much as one might expect for a minor injury on a Saturday night. I was there between two and three hours. Paperwork on my part was minimal, just signing three forms: a sign-in form, consent for getting a tetanus shot, and a discharge form. The nurses and the doctor appeared competent, not hurting me uneccesarily but getting the job done.</p>

<p>If you have to go to the emergency room, and you have a choice between Swedish in Ballard and somewhere else, pick Swedish.</p>
