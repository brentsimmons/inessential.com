<p>The story about the <a href="http://newsnet.reuters.com/cgi-bin/basketview.cgi?b=rcom:odd&s=nL19132485">armored van strike in France</a> reminds of a time Sheila and I were in Paris and unable to get cash from any cash machines. Very frustrating!</p>

<p>Thinking like Americans, we had gone to Paris expecting to be able to withdraw cash at will. We had an account with a national French bank, Crédit Agricole. (We were then living in Grenoble.)</p>

<p>After about a week in Paris the cash machines stopped allowing us withdraw money. It turned out that there&#039;s a limit to how much you can withdraw if you&#039;re outside your department. Since our account was with Crédit Agricole de l&#039;Isere, we were limited to something like 3,000 francs per week outside our department. (I don&#039;t recall the exact details.)</p>

<p>So we had no cash left, having blown it all on books in English at the Brentano&#039;s on rue de l&#039;Opéra. (And on cocktails and sandwiches at Harry&#039;s.)</p>

<p>We went into a Crédit Agricole branch near our hotel and told them we couldn&#039;t get any money from the cash machines. The fellow behind the counter didn&#039;t speak any English, which we found rare in Paris, but it was okay. He explained the situation about the limits. Then shrugged and told us we can&#039;t get any money, then turned back to some paperwork.</p>

<p>We&#039;re fuming at this point. I won&#039;t let him get back to work: there must be a way we can get some money. I&#039;m trying to draw him out, to tell me how I can get some of our money -- but all I get is that Gallic shrug, that Beckett-like nothing-to-be-done thing. After six months of living in France, Sheila and I were both <em>a little tired</em> of that.</p>

<p>Finally I asked him if I can write a check to the bank and get cash. The teller looked utterly defeated. Which I knew meant it was true, here was the solution, we could get some cash after all. And so we did.</p>

<p>Anyway: this moment turned the tide for us. It was our first major victory. After six months in France, we started to get the hang of things.</p>

<p>So if you&#039;re in Paris, and you see a Crédit Agricole not on but near rue Cler in the 7eme arrondisement, think of me and Sheila winning our own personal Battle of Paris.</p>

<p>You know what we did with our cash? My memory may be faulty, but I think that night we ate at Burger King on the Champs-Elysées and went to a <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/ebert/ebert_reviews/1993/01/801260.html">movie</a> starring Jeremy Irons. Just to celebrate.</p>

<p>The movie we went to was directed by <a href="http://entertainment.go.com/people/louismalle/content/Bio.html">Louis Malle</a>, who also directed <a href="http://aol.eonline.com/Facts/Movies/0,60,1160,00.html">Atlantic City</a>, one of my all-time faves.</p>

<p>Does anybody remember a TV series in the late &#039;70s about Lucan, a boy raised by wolves? I don&#039;t think it lasted an entire season. It may not have lasted an entire half-season. Lucan was incredibly strong and fast, and highly ignorant of civilization. A condition every 10-year-old boy aspires to.</p>

<p>(Aside: that stuff&#039;s fine for kids, but it freaks me out when adults go for that Rousseau noble savage junk when presented in more sophisticated forms.)</p>

<p>I couldn&#039;t find anything on the web about Lucan -- but I did find the unofficial <a href="http://www.primenet.com/~luethy/">Quark</a> home page (Quark was another short-lived late-&#039;70s show). Adam Quark, played by Richard Benjamin, was a garbage collector in space who had one mis-adventure after another. I loved this show. I wish Nick at Nite would show it -- a 4-hour marathon would do the trick, there were only eight episodes.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.inessential.com/sheila/2000/05/19">Sheila</a> and Mark Staben both pointed me to a <a href="http://www.ultimatetv.com/news/columns/mrtv/a/98/03/15mrtv.html">page on Lucan</a>. At least it proves I wasn&#039;t dreaming!</p>
