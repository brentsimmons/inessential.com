<p>I almost never make coffee at night. Tonight I made coffee.</p>

<p>Last night <a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/">Sheila</a> gave me a personality test about how you are at work. I got very balanced results. Which I could have predicted in advance, I always end up being pretty much equal parts this, that, and the other thing when taking these kinds of tests.</p>

<p>But I&#039;m not one of those people who say "moderation in all things." I have no aesthetic attraction to balance. Quite the opposite: I&#039;m friends with the out-of-kilter. The dis-equilibriate and I do lunch regularly. Acausality and I send our kids to the same school. When I party, I like to have drinks with my pals discontinuity and dissonance. The hyperbolic and I, well, we just like to chill.</p>

<p>This ain&#039;t <em>in</em>essential.com for no reason.</p>

<p>Of course, the end result of the test is to give you a personality type. I could have been an Organizer, Catalyst, Motivator, etc. etc. It labelled me a Developer. No surprise: that&#039;s my job title.</p>

<p>Despite my late-modernist tendencies, I can be fearlessly sentimental, which I don&#039;t mind telling you, bobouleh. Case in point: moments ago I saw a squirrel racing across the lawn, carrying a nut in its mouth. <em>I felt it in my heart.</em> That&#039;s completely ridiculous, all out of proportion. Which is probably why I don&#039;t mind.
