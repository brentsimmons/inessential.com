<p>Next question: How do you <em>set</em> the selected text in a textarea in Mac MSIE 5 using JavaScript? Supposedly it&#039;s impossible. That doesn&#039;t mean it can&#039;t be done. After all, getting the selected text was supposedly impossible, but there was a way.</p>

<p>Setting the selected text in a textarea is needed to get the JavaScript HTML Editor working that Windows MSIE 5 users already enjoy.</p>

<p><a href="http://manilaexpress.userland.com/">Manila Express</a> for Mac IE 5 has been released. Thanks to everybody who helped test and posted feedback to the discussion group here.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s <a href="http://manilaexpress.userland.com/stories/storyReader$224">how I did it</a>.</p>

<p>Late last night I did some recreational programming. Not programming exactly but investigation. I downloaded and installed <a href="http://www.python.org/download/download_mac.html">Python for Macintosh</a>. I wanted to see what it was like. (I&#039;ve used Python a little on Linux, and already knew I liked Python -- it&#039;s like Frontier in some ways.) Python for Macintosh is very nice! There&#039;s a mini-IDE. You can make double-clickable applets. There are a bunch of Mac-specific extensions. Etc.</p>

<p>I would expect Python -- with its emphasis on readability, with the Python community&#039;s emphasis on education and teaching newbies to program -- to gain ground on Mac OS. Perhaps even more so on Mac OS X, which will probably run the UNIX version of Python. (I hope it comes bundled with OS X.)</p>

<p>AppleScript rules the roost. My personal difficulty in learning AppleScript comes from the difference between actual human language and a syntax that appears human, but isn&#039;t. It&#039;s a temperament thing, different people&#039;s brains are wired differently. This is by no means a general criticism of AppleScript. But it does mean that there&#039;s room for more than one newbie-friendly scripting language on Mac OS.</p>

<p>A cool thing happened: I went to check out the <a href="http://dmoz.org/Computers/Systems/Macintosh/Development/Scripting/Python/">Mac Python links</a> on dmoz. As I was reading one of the pages linked to, I suddenly realized that I was reading a page on a Manila site. Hey -- that Members box looks familiar! Sure enough, it was an EditThisPage.Com site with a <a href="http://schockwellenreiter.editthispage.com/python/tkinterenglish.html">HowTo</a> on Mac Python and Tkinter. I like it when I end up at an ETP site when I&#039;m not expecting to.</p>
