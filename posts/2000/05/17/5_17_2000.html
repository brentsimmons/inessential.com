<p><a href="http://post695.editthispage.com/2000/05/17">It&#039;s a girl</a>! Congratulations to John and Indigo.</p>

<p>Halama pitched a <a href="http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com/u/ce/recap/0,2405,MLB_20000517_MIN@SEA,00.htm">complete game shutout</a> in 86 pitches, facing just 29 batters. It doesn&#039;t get much better than that. In other Mariners news, they&#039;ve <a href="http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com/u/baseball/mlbcom/news/may00/henderson_051700.htm">signed Rickey Henderson</a>.</p>

<p>Sprezzatura: <a href="http://sprezzatura.editthispage.com/2000/05/17">Go to Italy</a>. "Italy is every bit as romantic, as sensual, as grand, as intimate, as disorganized, as luxurious, as simple, as sophisticated, as earthy, as its reputation claims; except that everything is more so than anyone can imagined: a certain drama attaches."</p>

<p>Mariners <a href="http://www.mariners.org/gameday/recaps/5-16-00.asp">beat the Twins 9-5</a> last night. Mariners regain first place in the AL West.</p>

<p>Don&#039;t click here unless you want to be grossed out. If you can stomach it, it&#039;s oddly enthralling. <a href="http://www.stinkymeat.net/">www.stinkymeat.net</a></p>

<p><strong>TV</strong></p>

<p>The 2-hour season finale of Beverly Hills 90210 conflicts with a new Voyager and a new West Wing. We&#039;ve got two VCRs. As insane as it sounds, we may watch one of the shows and tape the other two. Hello, my name is Brent and I&#039;m a TV addict.</p>

<p>People say that TV is mostly garbage -- and they&#039;re totally right. It&#039;s worse than garbage, so much worse than garbage that there are no words for how bad it is. But there are a few, very few, good shows. (No, 90210 isn&#039;t one of them -- the season finale is a cultural event.)</p>

<p>It&#039;s good that TV is mostly worse than garbage. If it were mostly good -- were high quality the norm, not the rare exception -- we&#039;d be in a lot of trouble. Imagine that there&#039;s something genuinely worth watching every hour of the day. The economy would collapse from the loss in productivity. I kid thee not.</p>
