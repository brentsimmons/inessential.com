<p>Mariners face Oakland <a href="http://www.mariners.org/gameday/next-game_text.asp">tonight</a>. Yesterday&#039;s 7-6 loss to the Rangers in the bottom of the 9th was -- sports clich√© coming, wait for it -- heartbreaking, to say the least. Let&#039;s hope Gil Meche finally gets some run support tonight.</p>

<p>Sometimes you get an email that makes your day. I just got one from someone I never heard of (a nobody, I&#039;m sure) telling me about the sex I&#039;ve recently had with a variety of members of my family -- but especially my uncle. In all caps -- and rhyming! It&#039;s almost like a deranged, vulgar Dr. Seuss, beautiful and funny in its own way.</p>

<p>The good news is that <a href="http://array.editthispage.com/">Garret</a>&#039;s back. The bad news, I&#039;m sure you know by now, is that they&#039;re fighting major fires in New Mexico. If you can help, please do.</p>
