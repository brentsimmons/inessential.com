<p>***Nightly Updates Change</p>

<p>Important note for Frontier server managers: a change has been made regarding automatic nightly updates. They&#039;re no longer run when your overnight script runs, but at a semi-random 5 to 55 minutes later, to disperse requests to the root updates server. See <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$4117">Nightly Updates Changes</a> on the Frontier site.</p>

<p><strong>Apache stats</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.userland.com/mostReadSitesYesterday">Most Read Sites Yesterday</a> page doesn&#039;t include the static versions of <a href="http://qube.weblogs.com/">Qube Quorner</a>, <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>, and this site. It&#039;s easy to count stats for sites served by Frontier -- but the static versions of these sites are served by Apache.</p>

<p>Question: what&#039;s the most expedient way to count page reads for a virtual host served by Apache? I could turn on logging for those sites; I could run a script on the Linux box or in Frontier. If there&#039;s something off-the-shelf I could use, I&#039;d be happy to not have to re-invent the wheel. Any ideas?</p>

<p>What I want, exactly, is just one number per site, the number of page reads for the previous day. I want to get this number every night at midnight or just after.</p>

<p><strong>Misc.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://bluegreen.weblogs.com/">BlueGreen</a>: "Environmental News and Opinions." According to the <a href="http://bluegreen.weblogs.com/stories/storyReader$14">description page</a>: "It is a site that anyone can contribute to, very easily. In a cliche, it&#039;s &#039;environmental information by the people, for the people.&#039; Anyone can post something at any time." I&#039;ve come to trust the editor, Dru Jay, from reading <a href="http://misnomer.editthispage.com/">misnomer</a>, and expect good things from this site.</p>

<p>News.Com: <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1007-200-1877215.html?tag=st.ne.1002.bgif.ni">Oracle inks deals to boost portal push</a>. Whenever I hear the word "portal" and the name of a super-huge company used in the same sentence, I cringe and tune out. But maybe this is interesting. But maybe not. (That&#039;s razor-sharp analysis for ya.)</p>

<p>Luke&#039;s been following the news from <a href="http://tripping.seeto.com/">Zimbabwe</a>. I confess to not following it closely, it seems so far away. But these days, nothing&#039;s far away.</p>

<p>There&#039;s a <a href="http://realbasic.editthispage.com/">news site</a> for REALbasic developers.</p>

<p>I saw an ad on TV for <a href="http://www.snowball.com/">Snowball.com</a> last night. The site looks pretty boring, but I doubt I&#039;m part of the target audience.</p>

<p>Jeff&#039;s got pictures of <a href="http://ican.editthispage.com/soulDetour/2000/05/13/">Soul Detour&#039;s show</a> last Saturday. UserLand&#039;s <a href="http://jake.editthispage.com/">Jake Savin</a> plays what looks like a 5-string bass. <em>Update:</em> Jake <a href="http://editorial.inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$575">posts details</a> about his bass.</p>

<p>John posts his <a href="http://post695.editthispage.com/2000/05/14">book list</a>. Some of the books he mentioned would be honorable mentions on my list -- particularly White Noise, The Great Gatsby, and J.D. Salinger&#039;s books. About writing like Raymond Carver -- I tried to write like Raymond Carver too. When I wasn&#039;t trying to write like Donald Barthelme (whose 40 Stories would be an honorable mention on my list). That was the &#039;80s. I don&#039;t know who college students these days emulate. (If you know, let me know -- I&#039;m curious.)</p>

<p><a href="http://editorial.inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$573">John also asks</a> what&#039;s my take on the Mariners. They&#039;re in a slump. Three main factors: the number one and two starters are injured; Kazuhiro Sasaki is having trouble with his control; the offense is stranding runners on base. Every team goes through slumps -- that&#039;s why they play 162 games. The Yankees were just swept by the Tigers, for instance, knocking the Yankees out of first place. I except both the Yankees and the M&#039;s to regain first place. I do expect the current slump to last a few more days, but they&#039;ll start coming out of it before Moyer returns in about two weeks.</p>

<p>My foot is improving: I can walk on it normally now, though slowly. I don&#039;t have to walk on my heel.</p>
