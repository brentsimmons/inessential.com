<p>I&#039;m working on adding CSS support to objects that are created by Manila that you can&#039;t directly modify. Manila themes will be able to specify the CSS for a site. Better CSS support means better themes.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://www.handspring.com/">Handspring Visor</a> arrived today. New toy. I&#039;m excited.</p>

<p>More Manila widgets: <a href="http://www.cs.strath.ac.uk/~duncan/frontier/manilaclipper.html">Manila Clipper</a> by Duncan Smeed, <a href="http://traumwind.editthispage.com/gadgets/ManilaHelper">Manila Helper</a> from Martin Spernau.</p>

<p>Radio stations are a topic on <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/05/30">Scripting News</a> and the <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/">discussion group</a>. Were there an inessential.com radio station, it would be right now playing what I call "shipping music." Music for rude boys and girls: Skatalites, Specials, Madness, Sublime, Hepcat, Desmond Dekker, English Beat, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones. And of course the Clash, always the Clash, still the only band that matters.
