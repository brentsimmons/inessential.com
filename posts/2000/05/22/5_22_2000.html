<p>Travel day today for the Mariners. They won yesterday <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/mariners/html98/msap21_20000521.html">8-4</a>. For the second day in a row Rickey Henderson led off the first inning with a home run.</p>

<p>BBC News: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_758000/758948.stm">Theatres go dark for Gielgud</a>. "Theatre audiences across London&#039;s West End are remembering acting legend Sir John Gielgud, who has died aged 96."</p>

<p>PR: <a href="http://linuxpr.com/releases/1866.html">PHP 4.0 released</a>. According to the press release, it&#039;s faster.</p>

<p>ZDNet: <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2572821,00.html">Jini: Sun&#039;s incredible disappearing act</a>. "Sun&#039;s Joy has one explanation for all of the missing products. At a Silicon Valley conference this month, he blamed Jini&#039;s lack of momentum on telco deregulation, which he says has inhibited the establishment of a standard, persistent network."</p>

<p>These two sentences, from <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/runux3/">Running Linux</a> 3rd Edition, page 562, are a marvel of clarity and understatement. "Running your own web server is easy. It consists of two tasks: configuring the httpd daemon and writing documents to provide on the server." There&#039;s a whole world hidden in there. When I read it, I laughed. (It&#039;s a good book, by the way.)</p>
