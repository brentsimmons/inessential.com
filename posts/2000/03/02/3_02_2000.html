<p>John&#039;s looking for <a href="http://post695.editthispage.com/2000/03/02">XML-RPC support in Quark XPress</a>. Can anyone help? Any ideas? He wants to get Quark talking to Manila.</p>

<p>CBS News: <a href="http://cbsnews.cbs.com/now/story/0,1597,166937-412,00.shtml">Bush Bombs On Letterman</a>: "It means when it comes time to sew up your chest cavity, we use stitches as opposed to opening it up." Listen -- it&#039;s all over. Bush will win the nomination, but he&#039;s utterly and completely unelectable. I&#039;m calling the race now: Gore will be the next President of the United States.</p>

<p>Help! Since upgrading to Windows 2000, IE 5 does this obnoxious thing: it hides bookmarks (in the Favorites menu) that I haven&#039;t used lately. It adds these little downward-pointing arrows. I have to click on those to see all my bookmarks. The problem is that IE 5&#039;s definition of lately is sometimes just hours-long -- in the evening, it will hide bookmarks I haven&#039;t used since the morning. Super annoying! Does anyone know how to turn this off? I want to see all my bookmarks all the time.</p>

<p>Fresh Stuff: <a href="http://freshstuff.editthispage.com/">I Consume Myself</a>. Weight loss is a subject that interests me -- I lost 40 lbs. between the release of Frontier 6.0 and Frontier 6.1, a fact I&#039;m terribly proud of. (But there&#039;s more to go.)</p>

<p>Here&#039;s me before losing weight:</p>

<p>We should get better performance from the EditThisPage.Com server today. We have stats that show us which sites get the most picture requests. For the top 175 sites, we ran the updated <a href="http://samples.userland.com/stories/storyReader$95">copy pictures to static server</a> sample script. The upshot is that ETP.Com should handle almost no image requests.</p>

<p>Before we started writing pictures as individual files on disk, our stats were showing that picture requests were one-third of all requests.</p>
