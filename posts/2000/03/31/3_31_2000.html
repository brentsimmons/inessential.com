<p>Here&#039;s the <a href="http://mutantwatch.com/quiz.html">Mutant quiz</a> -- are you, possibly, a mutant? Via <a href="http://2020hindsight.editthispage.com/2000/03/31">2020 Hindsight</a>. The possibility that I&#039;m a mutant is <font color="red" size="-1">EXTREMELY HIGH</font>.</p>

<p>Back home today. Changes -- in the week-and-a-half I was gone, Spring started in Seattle. Nice.</p>

<p>I just had an NT 4 Server machine completely freeze up on me. Nuts. That&#039;s pretty rare, though -- the machine had been up for a few months.</p>

<p>I installed IE 5/Mac today. First thing I did was test it with the JavaScript HTML editor that shows up in Manila if you&#039;re using IE 5 for Windows. It didn&#039;t work. If there are any JavaScript experts that can figure out how to make it work with IE 5/Mac, let me know how to do it. (In Frontier, jump to mainResponder.discuss.getHtmlEditor. Comment out the block that reads <code>if not (lowerUserAgent contains "windows")</code>.)</p>

<p>Next question for IE 5/Mac folks -- how do you get an item into the ctrl-click menu? On Windows it&#039;s a registry entry. Simple answers, pointers to docs, etc. are welcome.</p>
