<p>I&#039;m not sure how I got this far without discovering the top command -- you&#039;re probably not sure either. But anyway, I sure like it. I&#039;ve discovered, for one thing, that my Linux machines are basically not breathing hard. The busiest Linux server on my LAN, an old LinuxPPC Mac 8500, hovers around 1-3% CPU usage. It&#039;s running Apache, DNS, a couple other services. I&#039;m not sure if top counts itself in the CPU usage number -- if it does, then normal CPU usage is even lower.</p>

<p>I&#039;m going to get a stats app -- probably Analog -- running on this machine soon. I&#039;d like to get an idea of how many hits it takes. I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s between 5K and 10K hits per day (not much) -- but I don&#039;t really know. I&#039;m leaning toward Analog because I&#039;ve used the Mac port.</p>
