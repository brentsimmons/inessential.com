<p>Lots of miscellaneous work today -- including tracking down a couple minor static rendering bugs.</p>

<p>On the radio the other day I heard <a href="http://www.cdnow.com/cgi-bin/mserver/pagename=/RP/CDN/FIND/album.html/artistid=SQUEEZE/itemid=320876">Squeeze</a>&#039;s Black Coffee in Bed. An old fave, a song I hadn&#039;t heard in a while. Now I can&#039;t get it out of my head! But that&#039;s okay. Of course these days it would say: "The stain on my <em>laptop</em> means nothing to me."
