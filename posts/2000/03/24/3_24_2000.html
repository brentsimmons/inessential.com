<p>I&#039;m editing this page in an outliner -- on a Mac, a PowerBook G3. Hello, Kitty. I had to switch from using IE 4.5 to Netscape, however. IE 4.5 has some terrible bugs. In a nutshell, it seems to not want to work with anything UserLand ever wants to do. Okay, that&#039;s just frustration talking. It&#039;s not really true.</p>

<p>We&#039;re still getting intermittent outages at the Woodside LAN. Very frustrating. But we continue anyway.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.inessential.com/sheila/">Sheila</a>&#039;s been re-designing her template -- using Pike, of course. If you&#039;ve done website framework sites in Frontier, you know how much nicer editing your template in an outline is over a textarea. For those of you who don&#039;t know -- you&#039;ll find out.</p>

<p>And now <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Dave</a>&#039;s editing his home page in an outline...
