<p><a href="http://www-4.ibm.com/software/developer/library/barcode/">GNOME&#039;s not Microsoft</a>: "&#039;The birth of GNOME happened about two and a half years ago,&#039; explains de Icaza, &#039;when Microsoft showed me a component-based application [Internet Explorer] which, instead of a huge bloated single-component application, was a huge application bloated with small components.&#039;"</p>

<p>I like these as antidotes to the current era of sunny, self-esteem-raising slogans. Maybe they&#039;re great as propaganda for kids, but adults use the stuff too.</p>

<p>Thinking more about slogans, one of my favorites is "violence never solved anything," which I&#039;ve been hearing since I was a kid. It&#039;s probably been around even longer. It&#039;s a sad day, like learning that Santa Claus doesn&#039;t exist, the day you learn that violence, far from being a poor problem-solver, is actually remarkably effective and popular. Very unfortunately.</p>

<p>On the other hand...</p>
