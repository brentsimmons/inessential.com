<p>Jeff Cheney is exploring ideas for <a href="http://loganalysis.editthispage.com/">log analysis for Manila Sites</a>.</p>

<p>New server just arrived. 700 MHz, PIII, 512MB RAM, CD-RW, 30 GB drive. Good chance it&#039;s going to be a search engine.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s a site I&#039;d like to see: a Yahoo-like directory for web developers. It wouldn&#039;t have to have original content, and it wouldn&#039;t focus on just open-source or just Manila or just Microsoft or just Java -- it would cover everything, with an easy-to-use hierarchy. I&#039;ve been wanting this site to exist for a few years, actually. Please someone do this.</p>

<p>Thousands of years from now, when archaeologists are digging up the remains of our current age, they&#039;re going to find lots of canned goods. If they can decipher our language, I bet they fix themselves a bowl of chicken soup. And I bet they like it. Then archaeology becomes a fiendish passion: they&#039;re all on a hunt for more soup.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.artexplore.com/maniweb/new_news.htm">Barry Manilow</a> is on tour. My inner child wants to hear "Copacabana" live. That&#039;s a joke, by the way. Or, actually, probably not.</p>
