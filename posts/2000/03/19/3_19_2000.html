<p>My birthday is a week from today -- but since I won&#039;t be home, I&#039;m celebrating with family today. Happy birthday to me! Sort of!</p>

<p>We used to sing: "Happy birthday to you -- you smell like a monkey -- and look like one too!"</p>

<p>I created a new site on <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/">Weblogs.Com</a> today -- not because I want a new weblog, but because I want the chance to experiment with a personal weblog portal. Here&#039;s the <a href="http://inessential.weblogs.com/">site</a>, still completely in its default state at this writing.</p>

<p>At Electric Dirt Farmer, lots of <a href="http://antecedent.editthispage.com/2000/03/19">notes on Zaplets</a>. I&#039;m having trouble getting excited about them.</p>

<p>I was thinking about intelligence. There are many types -- but two types often referred to, and measured by IQ tests, are spatial and verbal intelligence.</p>

<p>Then there is another set of types -- analytic and synthetic.</p>

<p>My theory: if you treat these two sets as x and y axes, the great minds of history, from Aristotle to Shakespeare to Einstein, would land squarely in the center.</p>

<p>Below is my graph -- I&#039;m the yellow dot. Balanced on one axis, very unbalanced on the other.</p>

<p>There is, of course, a third axis -- candlepower. One might be a balanced dim bulb. I don&#039;t even attempt to show a third axis here. (I probably couldn&#039;t figure out how to draw it anyway!)</p>

<p>Finally, there&#039;s a fourth axis, also not shown: time.</p>

<p><a href="http://frauke.editthispage.com/2000/03/18">Frauke</a> points to an article about women&#039;s IQs increasing during pregnancy.</p>
