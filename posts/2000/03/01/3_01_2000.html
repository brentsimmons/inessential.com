<p>I received <a href="http://www.metrowerks.com/desktop/linux/redhat/gnu/">CodeWarrior for Linux</a> today. Why did I go with CodeWarrior over KDevelop, etc.? Because I&#039;ve used CodeWarrior for MacOS for years: I like it, it&#039;s comfortable, I already know how to use it, and I&#039;ve come to trust Metrowerks tools. KDevelop sounded difficult to set up -- and it works like Microsoft Visual C++, which I don&#039;t care for that much, though I do use it on Windows. And the price was right: under $100 for CodeWarrior.</p>

<p>Welcome to March!</p>

<p>Sometimes you&#039;re working on new features, and sometimes you&#039;re working on performance. And sometimes performance is a feature.</p>

<p>I&#039;ve been going through some old folders with pictures in them. Some of you may vaguely recognize some of these as pictures I&#039;ve used on older sites, going back to 1995. These all pre-date my working for UserLand. I&#039;ve been working for UserLand for three years.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s an ancient company logo.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s an ancient navbar.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s an only slightly less ancient navbar.</p>

<p>For some strange reason, this blue circle figured prominently in the first MacBird site I did.</p>

<p>This one brings back memories.</p>

<p>Ancient Frontier/FileMaker based search engine I wrote.</p>

<p>The only excuse I have for this one is that it was 1996 and I thought Java might be cool. I wasn&#039;t wrong -- it might&#039;ve been cool, but it just didn&#039;t end up that way.</p>

<p>Scripting, of course, <em>is</em> cool.</p>
