<p>Redmonk: <a href="http://redmonk.editthispage.com/thoughts/iethoughts">IE thoughts</a>: "Important for users of UserLand&#039;s Pike: I think that IE now correctly reloads pages that were re-directed to, rather than re-posting whatever data went to the page that sent you there." We haven&#039;t checked this out yet, but it&#039;s true that IE 4.5 for Macs has some weird behavior with Pike -- behavior that may have been fixed in IE 5. If so, we may end up recommending using IE 5 on Macs. Netscape on Macs has another bug -- you can can&#039;t create new stories in Pike. (Not sure if Netscape for Windows has the same bug.)</p>

Maybe André&#039;s homesick for home cooking? But even I know that Wiener Schnitzel is <em>Austrian</em>.</p>

<p>If you&#039;re a Manila server manager trying to get Pike support working on your server, here&#039;s a page with a <a href="http://pikebeta.userland.com/stories/storyReader$650">few tips</a>.</p>

<p>It&#039;s my birthday today! I turned 32. We took a break, went driving, ate spicy noodles.</p>

<p>I had a great time at ManilaPalooza! Thanks to everyone who attended -- and to the people I got to meet for the first time and the people I got to see again.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s the fella who kept refilling my margarita glass at the post-ManilaPalooza dinner:</p>
