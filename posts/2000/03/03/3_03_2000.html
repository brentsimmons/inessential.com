<p>What is it about Seattle-area high-tech companies? Microsoft, Amazon, Real. There&#039;s an obvious abuse-of-power thread going on here.</p>

<p>When I was originally looking for a domain name for this website, it came down to two choices: inessential.com and oldmeat.com. Note: oldmeat.com is <a href="http://whois.userland.com/default$oldmeat.com">still available</a>.</p>

<p>If you don&#039;t like Linux -- and I do like Linux, but maybe you don&#039;t -- you could register <a href="http://whois.userland.com/default$tuxsucks.com">tuxsucks.com</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think the reason why I sit so much in front of a computer is physiological -- the light from the monitor is crude treatment for <a href="http://www.mentalhealth.com/book/p40-sad.html">seasonal affective disorder</a>. (No, I don&#039;t really have SAD. But I do get really tired of the cold and cloudy days of Winter.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.inessential.com/sheila/2000/03/03">Sheila</a>&#039;s added links to her most-visited weblogs to her template. I&#039;m glad she did, it&#039;s a good practice. One of the logs she links to is <a href="http://qube.seeto.com/">Tripping</a>!, Luke Tymowski&#039;s other weblog.</p>

<p>Luke writes: "What does Tripping refer to? Trip the light fantastic. That phrase came to mind when I was thinking of a title. It probably sounds druggy. But I&#039;ve never so much as smoked a cigarette. So don&#039;t take it too seriously."</p>

<p>Here&#039;s a picture of Luke, from Tripping&#039;s <a href="http://qube.seeto.com/about/index.html">about page</a>:</p>

<p>Luke&#039;s Manila weblog is, of course, <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/qube/">QubeQuorner</a>, one of my personal favorites.</p>

<p>I&#039;m a little confused by the rumors. Is there going to be a new Star Trek series, or not? Do you know the scoop on this?</p>
