<p>Doctor Doctor, I&#039;ve got <a href="http://carpediem.editthispage.com/">carpe diem</a> withdrawal. Got the shakes, real bad.</p>

<p>Do you keep books in your refrigerator? It doesn&#039;t really help, you know.</p>

<p>Sometimes only <a href="http://www.towerrecords.com/product.asp?pfid=1031469">Hepcat</a> scratches the itch I got.</p>

<p>Joe Barton -- I mean, <a href="http://vfih.editthispage.com/">John VanDyk</a> -- wonders if I&#039;m a closet Republican. Nope! Unless being pro-choice, pro-labor, pro-freedom-of-speech, pro-gun-control, pro-environment, anti-death-penalty, pro-separation-of-church-and-state, anti-flag-burning-amendment, anti-Proposition-22, pro-science-funding, etc. makes me a Republican.</p>

<p>Actually, like many Americans neither major party fits me exactly. I&#039;m extremely liberal on social issues, but tend toward fiscal conservatism. But: I&#039;ve never voted for a Republican in my life, and there&#039;s a strong chance I never will.</p>

<p>That doesn&#039;t mean I don&#039;t recognize character and vision no matter where it appears.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s what I think most Americans think. They think that if Thomas Jefferson were alive today he&#039;d agree with them on every issue. Republicans think that, Democrats think that, independents think that. If you&#039;re an American, I bet you think that. I certainly do. We can&#039;t all be right! But that&#039;s okay.</p>

<p><a href="http://mccainsnavy.editthispage.com/2000/03/07">McCain&#039;s Navy</a> has a picture of the candidate and his wife. I sure wish McCain had won big yesterday. I&#039;m not sure why I care so much, not being a Republican, but... oh well.</p>

<p>I take that back. I do know why I care. I listened to McCain&#039;s speech and remembered why. Because he says the right things about democracy. I don&#039;t agree with him on 9 out of 10 issues -- but on the fundamental need to strengthen our democratic tradition, I&#039;m right there with him. I don&#039;t hear anybody else talking about this stuff.</p>
