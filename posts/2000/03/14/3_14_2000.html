<p>According to a posting on the LinuxPPC announcement list, Jason Haas of <a href="http://www.linuxppc.com/">LinuxPPC</a> was in a serious accident. Jeff Carr wrote: "Jason was going to email this out to everyone, but I have the sad job of reporting to you that he was in a serious accident on Friday -- hit by a DUI driving a tahoe. He is in bad shape, but is looking better today. I&#039;m trying to keep up with what email he has so if you email kind things to him i&#039;ll pass them on." Jason&#039;s email address is jhaas@linuxppc.com. Best wishes for a quick recovery.</p>

Next stop is the Washington state supreme court.</p>
