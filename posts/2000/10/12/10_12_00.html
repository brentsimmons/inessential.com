<p>Thanks to Steve Ivy for the link to <a href="http://www.gwbushsucks.com/">GWBushSucks.Com</a>.</p>

<p>Note to <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/2000/10/10">Steve</a> (who is <em>not</em> the anti-me): I&#039;d probably vote Republican too, if Republican leaders actually believed in the same things you do. They don&#039;t. Two words: corporate welfare.</p>

<p>It turns out there&#039;s a <a href="http://www.corporatewelfare.com/">corporatewelfare.com</a>! "Before you consider lobbying for corporate welfare, have you: Lowered workers wages as your profits have shot up?"</p>

<p>I&#039;ve heard that the Mac OS X developer tools are now available for download to on-line ADC members. (As I recall, being an on-line member is free.) I wonder if, were I starting a project from scratch, would I use Project Builder/Interface Builder or CW Pro 6?</p>

<p>Actually, because I&#039;m a freak, I&#039;d probably use neither, I&#039;d write command line apps. Why? Because they&#039;re restful -- so much of my work is UI work. The command line is a vacation. It&#039;s like going without shaving, drinking a six-pack of beer, sleeping past noon.</p>

<p>Plus, there&#039;s something delightfully perverse about writing command line apps for Macs.</p>

<p>Luckily, for me and the rest of the world, I&#039;m not starting a project from scratch.</p>

<p>Boy am I ever tired of spam advertising printer supplies. Hello, I don&#039;t even own a printer. And if I did, I&#039;d trade it for a dog. Then I&#039;d give the dog to a good home.</p>

<p>While I do think it&#039;s easier to write negative than celebratory prose, I take some measure of inspiration from The Flangy News. Consider <a href="http://TheFlangyNews.editthispage.com/2000/10/09">this day</a>, with two gems: "My car tried to kill me when I got in it after work..." and "HTML is a harsh master. And a cruel mistress. And I don&#039;t mean the good kind of cruel mistress..."
