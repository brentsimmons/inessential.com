<p>Bunch of Manila changes -- see <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/news/2000/10/26">today&#039;s Frontier News</a>.</p>

<p>Do you use CodeWarrior 6? Maybe you can help me.</p>

<p>It broke me terribly. It used to be that, when I wanted to jump to a function, I could command-double-click on the reference and the function would open. (Like in Frontier.)</p>

<p>Now it doesn&#039;t.</p>

<p>Is there some setting somewhere I can set to get this back? Or is there another way to do this?</p>

<p>(There&#039;s other breakage, too. So far I&#039;m disappointed with this release. It runs on OS X, which I like. But the debugger apparently doesn&#039;t work out-of-the-box, which I hate.)</p>

<p>Hi, we&#039;re the New York Yankees, and we&#039;re buying another World Series.</p>

<p>When will major league baseball wise up and do what the other major sports do? Yes, we need some sort of salary cap and some form of profit sharing.</p>

<p>Bit of trivia you may or may not recall: the original tagline for this site was "You don&#039;t need to be here." In keeping with that contrary attitude, I was considering doing a series of Quotes You Don&#039;t Agree With.</p>

<p>It&#039;s easy to find quotes that make everyone go -- yeah, that&#039;s cool, right on, you go Einstein. (Or Lincoln or Picasso or Woolf or whatever.)</p>

<p>Finding quotes I like but most people won&#039;t is a bit more challenging.</p>

<p>So it&#039;s too much work and I&#039;m not going to do it.</p>

<p>But here&#039;s what would have been the first quote. Oscar Wilde, in a letter: "It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible."</p>

<p>Here&#039;s my theory as to why the presidential race is so close.</p>

<p>1. Americans vote for the taller candidate.</p>

<p>2. Americans vote for the anti-intellectual candidate.</p>

<p>Gore is taller; W. is anti-intellectual.</p>

<p>W.&#039;s father beat Dukakis because he was both taller and anti-intellectual. Slam-dunk. Clinton beat Dole because Clinton was taller -- and Dole wasn&#039;t actually anti-intellectual.</p>

<p>There isn&#039;t always an anti-intellectual candidate. But when there is, and he&#039;s the shorter guy, you&#039;ve got confusion.</p>

<p>Me, I&#039;m writing in Martin Sheen.</p>

<p>After re-reading today&#039;s weblog it occurs to me that I&#039;m a crank.
