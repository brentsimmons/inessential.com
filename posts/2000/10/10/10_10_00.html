<p><strong>Mariners win game one!</strong></p>

<p>Warning: the below is unfair. Do not read any further if you can&#039;t stand being curious and not having your curiosity satisfied. I mean it. I will not satisfy your curiosity; nor will I run a survey. I&#039;m telling you to click the Back button in your browser right now. No joke.</p>

<p>They say if you live long enough you&#039;ll meet your double. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s true -- but I&#039;ve met my anti-double, my exact opposite, the anti-me. Or, I should say, I&#039;ve met the weblog that is the exact opposite of mine.</p>

<p>It would be impolitic to point to it -- but don&#039;t worry, no, it&#039;s not <em>your</em> weblog, definitely not. Relax! In fact, I highly doubt the author of the weblog I&#039;m talking about reads mine.</p>

<p>But it&#039;s amazing. Every time I read it -- I tend to avoid it, actually -- I&#039;m stunned. I disagree with <em>every single sentence</em>. There isn&#039;t a sentiment expressed I don&#039;t take immediate issue with.</p>

<p>It gets my blood boiling, every time, without fail.</p>

<p>The site I&#039;m talking about is well-regarded, is rather popular. The author is very opinionated. It seems like just about everyone else in the world digs it.</p>

<p>At times there&#039;s a deafening chorus of me-toos. It&#039;s not just that people enjoy the site -- they agree with it.</p>

<p>And yet... this weblog is 100% completely and perfectly wrong about every single thing. In my opinion.</p>

<p>To me it reads like: "Pure evil is good." And people say: "Right on! You hit the nail on the head with that pure evil thing! So insightful!"</p>

<p>I guess I&#039;m lucky that there&#039;s just the one weblog out of thousands that drives me nuts.</p>

<p><img src="/images/atom.gif" height="30" width="29" border="0" alt="" /></p>

<p>My point isn&#039;t really about the specific case of me and this weblog. Which is partly why I&#039;ll never reveal which one it is. I&#039;m interested in the experience itself.</p>

<p>Is there a weblog that is the exact opposite of yours? Or is it just me, is this a unique experience?</p>

<p>I&#039;m not talking about weblogs you don&#039;t like -- surely there are a few, out of the thousands, you don&#039;t care for -- I&#039;m talking about a weblog that to you is wrong in every way possible on every level.</p>

<p>Paul Victor Novarese <a href="http://editorial.inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$963">knows</a> what I&#039;m talking about -- he has <em>two</em> opposites. So I&#039;m not alone in this. Paul writes: "For some reason I continue to read both of them occasionally (about once a week). I suppose my masochistic side is afraid it might miss something."</p>

<p>Why did I name this weblog <em>inessential.com</em>? Because I&#039;m a contrary bastard. From the start I set myself up to be the opposite of something.</p>

<p><img src="/images/atom.gif" height="30" width="29" border="0" alt="" /></p>

<p>Two people have guessed <a href="http://www.camworld.com/">camworld</a>. While not my favorite weblog, that&#039;s not it.</p>

<p>I&#039;m pretty certain that it&#039;s un-guessable.
