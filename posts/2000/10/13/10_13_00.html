<p>Delicate work. We&#039;ve got the tree guys here trimming back a silver leaf maple -- that hangs right over the T1 line. If a branch falls the wrong way... They&#039;re being careful. I&#039;m being paranoid.</p>

<p>Update -- the tree guys are finished. The T1 line is still connected. Whew.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s a bug I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m going to report.</p>

<p>If I&#039;m doing a build on Mac OS X with CW Pro 6, <em>and I&#039;m wearing my black slippers</em>, the mouse pointer disappears and I have keyboard control only.</p>

<p>100% reproducable.
