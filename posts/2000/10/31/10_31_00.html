<p>I live in one of those neighborhoods where kids still actually go door-to-door seeking candy. I bought candy. I&#039;m ready for them. Hello, little kiddies.</p>

<p>Got Manila running on OS X! I was testing on an old copy of a backup of this weblog. Here&#039;s a large-ish {pictureLink ("screen shot", "largeOsXShot.gif")}.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s something else I tried, just for jazz. Can you write AppleScript scripts in Frontier on OS X? Yes. It worked the first time. I chose AppleScript from the language menu, wrote a one line script, ran it, it worked. Just another indication that lots of things are working, in both Frontier and in OS X itself.</p>

<p>OS X tip: I discovered you can get a Restart command if you hold down option -- Shut Down becomes Restart. Useful if you&#039;re in my shoes, having to switch between OS X and OS 9.</p>

<p>Another tip -- there&#039;s a chess app. I played a game. The computer whipped me. I totally suck at chess, though I enjoy it. (Spatial intelligence is pretty low on the human side of my keyboard.)</p>

<p>I&#039;m starting to like some things about Aqua. I&#039;ve got lots of complaints, for sure, and more all the time. (It&#039;s beta software, what do you expect?) But one thing I&#039;ve learned to like is the NeXT-style file system browser. It&#039;s a time saver, a screen real estate saver.</p>
