<p>In 1972 the Supreme Court ruled that the death penalty was unconstitutional. In 1976 they reversed that ruling.</p>

<p>Don&#039;t think things change? Sure they do.</p>

<p>It&#039;s fashionable this election season, as it often is, to say there are no differences between the two major parties, that they&#039;re both in the pockets of big business.</p>

<p>Somewhat true. Rather true. But not true enough to be true.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s an issue where it&#039;s not true: abortion. There is a difference between the two parties here -- and the opportunity for the next president to make major changes.</p>

<p>Do you care about this issue? I hope you do. Remember: things change. (That may be heartening or dis-heartening to you when applied to the abortion issue.)</p>

<p>People often say they don&#039;t have litmus tests. I do. I&#039;ll vote or not vote for a candidate based on their position on abortion.</p>

<p>Luckily, one party has a stand on abortion that I agree with, so I vote for candidates from that party.</p>

<p>The other day I saw part of the infamous Kennedy-Nixon presidential debate of 1960. (Yes, Nixon looked awful -- apparently he was getting over a cold. Kennedy had just returned from campaigning in California. He was tan and attractive. Both were good speakers. Kennedy won the TV version of the debate -- Nixon won the radio version. Same debate, but TV beat radio. History.)</p>

<p>Kennedy said something that struck me. He said that one had to choose which person and <em>which party</em> was the right one to lead the country. He said he was from the party that had produced Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Harry Truman. He didn&#039;t try to downplay his partisanship -- he sounded proud.</p>

<p>Nixon could have said the same thing -- and mentioned Theodore Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower. (And perhaps he did; I didn&#039;t hear the entire debate.)</p>

<p>What struck me was that it didn&#039;t used to be a bad thing to say: I&#039;m the xxxxx candidate, and here are the guys that came before me, and I&#039;m going to try and be like them.
