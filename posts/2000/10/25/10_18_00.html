<p>Dave&#039;s been talking about <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/10/25">Roger Clemens batting</a>. This reminds me of the one time I actually recall Clemens batting. Under certain circumstances the pitcher will bat in the AL. (It&#039;s rare.) This was several years ago, when Clemens was still with the Red Sox. A regular season game against the Mariners. Clemens pitched a thing of beauty -- I don&#039;t remember the details, but the Mariners offense was completely shut down.</p>

<p>To top it all off, he batted at the end of the game. He hadn&#039;t been throwing at our batters, so we didn&#039;t throw at him.</p>

<p>Clemens, who probably hadn&#039;t batted in years, hit a single. <em>Bastard</em>.
