<p>Stat of the day: 4-0. Four wins, zero losses.</p>

<p>When facing post-season elimination versus the Yankees, the Mariners are 4-0. They have never lost.</p>

<p>To clarify:</p>

<p>In 1995, they faced a do-or-die situation three games in a row -- and won each game, thereby winning the series. Down 0-2 in a five-game series, they beat the Yankees in each of the next three to move on to the ALCS. (Where they lost to the Indians.)</p>

<p>Yesterday&#039;s game was the fourth do-or-die win in a row versus the Yankees.</p>

<p>John Lewis has his own stat of the day -- "ten pounds of fluid ride in the hump of a camel."</p>

<p>This has not passed the inessential.com fact-checking team. (Those poor underpaid bastards, working on their novels late at night, wondering if they&#039;ll ever meet a city gal as nice as the phillies back home in Kansas.)</p>

<p>I keep wondering if the design of this site can get more minimal. I think it can.
