<p><a href="http://macosxcarbon.editthispage.com/2000/10/24">News from Tim</a> on the Carbon port of Frontier: "The good news is, I am finally able to debug on OS X PB with CodeWarrior. There are a few new problems that cropped up during the transition to OS X PB, but I hope to have those ironed out quickly."</p>

<p>Translated -- the Carbon port was running pretty well on OS 9, but it crashed on OS X right after the splash screen. Tim finally got the debugger working on OS X -- so progress can be made.
