<p>Yankees win 7-1. Nuts! The series record is 1-1, the M&#039;s coming away with a split in Yankee Stadium before returning to Safeco field for three games.</p>

<p>The Yanks were getting shut out until the 8th, then they scored big. They say even God believed in Yankee-style baseball. Genesis: "In the big inning..."</p>

<p>(That joke was old when Abner Doubleday was young.)</p>
