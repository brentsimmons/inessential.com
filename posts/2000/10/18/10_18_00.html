<p>Pitchers and catchers report to spring training in less than four months.</p>

<p>I&#039;m old-fashioned in some ways. I always thought chiropractors were a species of witch doctor. (Despite having a chiropractor in the family.)</p>

<p>But yesterday I had lower-back pain so intense I could barely move, let alone walk. Somehow I managed to hobble the two blocks from my house to the local chiropractor. So much for thinking they&#039;re witch doctors -- the first time in my life I had serious back pain, I went straight there.</p>

<p>It helped. Whew.</p>

<p>Turned out it&#039;s nothing very serious, just a sacral-iliac inflammation. (Something like that, anyway.) I&#039;m not fixed, but I can walk around much better.</p>

<p>It&#039;s weird, though -- getting up from my chair, or trying to tie my shoes, my motions -- slow, with some grimacing -- remind me of my great-grandfather.
