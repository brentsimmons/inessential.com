<p>Manila&#039;s <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaNewbies/stories/storyReader$2527">news archive link</a> feature has been <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaNewbies/stories/storyReader$2718">released</a>. Previously available only to EditThisPage.Com and Weblogs.UserLand.Com users, it&#039;s now a standard feature of Manila.</p>

<p>New Manila feature: you can <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaNewbies/stories/storyReader$2717">turn off title display</a> on archived home pages, just as you can for the home page itself.</p>

<p>Mariners win <a href="http://www.mariners.org/gameday/recaps/4-9-00.asp">9-3</a>. They took the Red Sox 2 out of 3 games -- then took the Yankees 2 out of 3 games. Nice.</p>

<p>PikeBeta: <a href="http://pikebeta.userland.com/stories/storyReader$894">International character fixes</a>. When one uses a Mac workstation with a Windows server, and vice versa, international characters will be properly converted.</p>

<p> <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$3710">Static rendering bug fixes</a>. New sites get properly initialized now; the unwanted compile-changes-on-saving dialog that appeared on Macs is gone.</p>

<p>Samuel Reynolds: <a href="http://plugins.launchpoint.net/">3rd Party Plugins</a>. It&#039;s a place for distributing and talking about Manila plug-ins by Frontier developers.</p>
