<p>Sheila reports on the <a href="http://www.inessential.com/sheila/2000/04/06">big sad fire</a> in our neighborhood last night.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mariners.org/gameday/recaps/4-5-00.asp">Revenge of the Mariners</a>. Beat Red Sox 9-3 last night. Tonight: Aaron Sele vs. former Mariner Jeff Fassero. If Fassero pitches like he did for the Mariners, expect the M&#039;s to hit half-a-dozen home runs tonight.</p>
