<p>10:48 p.m. -- Servers are coming back on-line. So far so good.</p>

<p>8:22 p.m. -- The move is in progress. We just updated DNS. The servers that are moving are off-line.</p>

<p>7:50 p.m. -- the move is about to start.</p>

<p>It&#039;s moving day -- many UserLand servers are moving tonight to Exodus. More details on <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/04/29">Scripting News</a>.</p>

<p>A few servers will not be moving: Scripting News is already at Exodus, for instance. In addition, email and mailing list servers and sites hosted in Seattle -- Frontier, DocServer, Dan Gillmor&#039;s site, this site, <a href="http://www.inessential.com/sheila/">Sheila&#039;s web site</a>, some others -- will remain up during the move.</p>
