<p>Mariners beat Yankees 7-5. <a href="http://media.mariners.org/players/Player_data_obj.asp?playerid=120">Kazuhiro Sasaki</a>, the all-time saves leader in Japan, gets his second American save. Center fielder <a href="http://media.mariners.org/players/Player_data_obj.asp?playerid=125">Mike Cameron</a> robs Derek Jeter of a home run, gets multiple standing ovations. Here&#039;s the <a href="http://www.mariners.org/gameday/recaps/4-7-00.asp">recap</a>.</p>

<p>Mariners beat the Red Sox (again) <a href="http://www.mariners.org/gameday/recaps/4-6-00.asp">5-2</a>. Tonight&#039;s game is against the Yankees: Halama vs. Pettite.</p>

<p>The Mariners are tied with the A&#039;s for <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/statistics/2000/bba/teampit.html">best team ERA</a> in all of major league baseball. Sure, it&#039;s super-early in the season -- but this is still encouraging! </p>

<p>Though the SPEEA strike ended, my <a href="http://www.inessential.com/mjdavis/">Mom</a>&#039;s leaving Boeing for <a href="http://advanceonline.com/">AdvanceOnline.Com</a>. There&#039;s a thread here: both my Mom and sister work for companies that do web-based education. And, of course, part of my job is writing HowTos and docs for people who are learning Frontier, Manila, and Pike. Are we all teachers at heart? Looking back to previous generations -- it appears to run in the family.</p>
