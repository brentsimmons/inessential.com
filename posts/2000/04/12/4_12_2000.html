<p>Aaron Sele pitched a 3-hit complete game shutout. M&#039;s beat the Tigers 4-0.</p>

<p>Gratuitous chance not to link to Amazon: I just started reading <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0374522839">The Death of Artemio Cruz</a> by Carlos Fuentes.</p>

<p>Ryan Anderson is pitching today for the <a href="http://www.rainiers.com/">Rainiers</a>. He&#039;s amazing. Sheila and I saw him play in a spring training game against the Phillies. You&#039;ll be hearing his name more and more.</p>

<p>Sheila&#039;s got <a href="http://www.inessential.com/sheila/2000/04/11">pictures</a> of our trip last month to San Juan Battista, the day after ManilaPalooza.</p>

<p>Qube Quorner now has a <a href="http://qube.weblogs.com/">static version</a>, using Manila&#039;s <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/manila/staticRendering/">static rendering feature</a>.</p>

<p>Well -- the Mariners lost yesterday. They&#039;ll make it up <a href="http://www.mariners.org/gameday/next-game_text.asp">today</a>. Aaron Sele is the starting pitcher.</p>

<p>A story I&#039;ve been planning to write: Why I Like Linux. I haven&#039;t written it yet. But here&#039;s the gist: Linux is like Frontier in that it&#039;s a large system with lots of text, hierarchies, and rules. The important thing is that it may take work to learn it, but it&#039;s <em>knowable</em>. The more you learn the more it makes sense, you start to be able to predict things. There&#039;s even a kind of beauty that reveals itself. Windows is much less knowable. I&#039;ve been a Windows user longer than I&#039;ve been a Linux user (and a Mac user longer still) -- but on Windows I quickly get to a point where there is only the unknowable. I&#039;m not talking about the kernel here -- I&#039;ve never looked at the Linux kernel source code -- I&#039;m talking about all the layers above it. I&#039;m talking about configuring Apache vs. configuring IIS, I&#039;m talking about the day-to-day of admin and script-writing and so on. Windows hides, Linux reveals.</p>

<p>But -- it depends on temperament. The same virtues that Frontier has are the virtues that attract me to Linux. Not everyone shares my temperament. (Thank goodness.)</p>

<p>On the other hand, I very much appreciate UIs that are easy-to-use. I&#039;m not a command-line snob. I remain a Mac user, too. Manila could be much harder to use than it is -- it could also be easier. We&#039;re working on it.</p>

<p>What drives me crazy is the middle ground occupied by Windows. It appears to give you the control of Linux, but doesn&#039;t. It appears to give you the ease-of-use of the Mac, but doesn&#039;t.</p>

<p>Finally, to close out this rant -- the irony is that most of the time I&#039;m in front of a Windows machine. It&#039;s not universally horrible in all ways. I could honestly write a story about why I like Windows. Perhaps tomorrow. (And I&#039;ll give the Linux desktop a sound thrashing while I&#039;m at it.)</p>

<p>The point is, everything&#039;s kind of half good.</p>
