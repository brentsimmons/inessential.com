<p>Uh-oh, the <a href="http://www.inessential.com/sheila/2000/04/14">missionaries finally found us</a>.</p>

<p>Final: 11-9, Mariners win. An ugly game. But -- you gotta win the ugly ones, they&#039;re still wins.</p>

<p>7th inning -- 9-6. Ooops. Here comes the Blue Jays.</p>

<p>5th inning -- Carlos Delgado&#039;s home run in the 3rd brings the Blue Jays a run. It&#039;s 9-1.</p>

<p>2nd inning -- Wells is outta there, we&#039;re into the Toronto bullpen. Now it&#039;s 9-0 Mariners. This feels good after getting shut out yesterday.</p>

<p>1st inning -- Mariners score 6, on three-run home runs by Edgar Martinez and Dan Wilson.</p>

<p>Today the Mariners go up against the Toronto Blue Jays, the first in a three-game series.</p>

<p>Note to M&#039;s: please cut Mesa. Please.</p>
