<p>Thanks to everyone who helped test -- and now, it&#039;s <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$3742">hashed cookies</a> time... The upshot is that there&#039;s a new cookie format that uses <a href="http://docserver.userland.com/string/hashMD5">string.hashMD5</a> to encrypt the contents of the cookie. It&#039;s more secure.</p>

<p>Happy Birthday <a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/">Wes</a>!</p>

<p>The Mariners are travelling today -- next game is tomorrow at Detroit. The M&#039;s have the best <a href="http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com/u/baseball/mlb/2000RS_stats/tpALera.htm">team ERA</a> in the American League at 2.83, second only to the NL&#039;s Arizona Diamondbacks. If you&#039;re not a Mariners fan, you have no idea how good it feels to be able to say this, how long we&#039;ve waited to be able to say this.</p>

<p>Note to the M&#039;s: cut Mesa, keep Halama in the bullpen, bring up Brett Tomko or Ryan Anderson from AAA Tacoma.
