<p>It was horrible. I not only got my first blue-screen NT 2000 crash, but on restart I got the message: "Cannot find the Operating System" in stark white letters on a black background. I re-started again, and it found the OS the second time. But imagine the fear. Sheesh.</p>

<p>John Olerud&#039;s three-run home run in the bottom of the 9th <a href="http://www.mariners.org/gameday/recaps/4-23-00.asp">wins the game</a> -- and the Mariners complete a three-game sweep of the Kansas City Royals.</p>

<p>Sheila&#039;s got <a href="http://www.inessential.com/sheila/2000/04/23">cool baseball pictures</a> from a late spring training game against the Phillies.</p>

<p>I asked earlier about support for script libraries in PHP -- apparently there is such support, and it appears pretty easy to use. I just didn&#039;t find it when I went looking: I&#039;ll look some more. Thanks to artboy of <a href="http://aaronland.net/">aaronland.net</a> for sending me email.</p>
