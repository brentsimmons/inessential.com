<p>You asked and asked and asked and asked and asked -- and now it&#039;s coming. Soon.</p>

<p>We&#039;re experiencing intermittent outages, again, on our main California LAN. Sheila has <a href="http://www.inessential.com/sheila/2000/04/13">pictorial commentary</a>.</p>

<p>Jos√© Mesa, the Mariners&#039; one bad pitcher, <a href="http://majorleaguebaseball.sportsline.com/u/sports/mlb/2000/0413/gamecenter/MLB_20000413_SEA@DET.htm">blew it</a>. </p>

<p>Gil Meche, 2.08 ERA, starts for the Mariners <a href="http://www.mariners.org/gameday/next-game_text.asp">today</a> in the rubber game of the three-game set against the Tigers in Comerica Park. He goes up against Hideo Nomo. Nomo&#039;s been tough this year so far -- in two starts his ERA is 1.93.</p>

<p>Mariners <a href="http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com/u/baseball/mlb/2000RS_stats/tpALera.htm">team ERA</a> is down to 2.79, fully a point better than the second-best AL pitching staff (Cleveland Indians, 3.99) -- and better than the NL&#039;s best (Arizona Diamondbacks, 2.86).</p>

<p>Looks like the Rainiers (AAA Tacoma) <a href="http://www.minorleaguebaseball.com/teams/lib/newboxscore.php3?league=pcl&team=tac">lost</a> yesterday -- but Ryan Anderson went 6 innings, giving up two earned runs, two walks, one home run -- the only hit he gave up. He struck out 10.</p>
