<p>The Seattle Manila/Pike/Frontier Users Group will be <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$16397">meeting Tuesday April 25</a> on Capitol Hill. "We will be discussing Pike and Manila, with an emphasis on the user&#039;s point of view. We invite users and those who want to be users to come and check it out." I hope to see you there!</p>

<p>Sox rock M&#039;s, <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/mariners/html98/18mari_20000418.html">18-11</a>. Nuts!</p>

<p>The Mariners play the Chicago White Sox at <a href="http://www.mariners.org/gameday/next-game_text.asp">5:05 Pacific</a> today. Will the offense continue? The Mariners broke a team record for most runs scored in three games in their series versus the Blue Jays.</p>

<p><a href="http://cnnsi.com/baseball/mlb/ml/players/5062/">Aaron Sele</a> pitches for the M&#039;s tonight. His last start was a complete game shutout against the Tigers.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s why I think <a href="http://www.squirrels.org/">squirrels</a> are tough. At least in my neighborhood, they&#039;re the only untamed mammal -- apart from humans -- that runs around doing their things in plain sight during the day.</p>

<p>Keola points out <a href="http://editorial.inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$449">another similarity</a> between squirrels and people.
