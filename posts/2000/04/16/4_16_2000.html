<p><a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaNewbies/discuss/msgReader$2854">Custom icons for bookmarks</a>. Here&#039;s how, using the Gems feature, you can have a custom icon when someone makes your site a favorite.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zeldman.com/coming.html">Zeldman</a>: "Several friends and readers have pointed out that our icons are used extensively at Dave Winer&#039;s weblogs.com. Actually, Dave has been doing this for a while, now. But does he call? Does he write?"</p>

<p>Manila&#039;s new <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaNewbies/stories/storyReader$2846">Gems</a> feature allows you to "upload files of any type -- movies, sound files, zip files, spreadsheets, etc. -- to your Manila website."</p>

<p>Mariners beat the Blue Jays <a href="http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com/u/sports/mlb/2000/0416/gamecenter/MLB_20000416_SEA@TOR.htm">19-7</a>. Grand slam by A-Rod -- one of three home runs for the shortstop today. This completes a three-game sweep in Toronto. I&#039;m glad to see the Mariners leave that ball park -- these football-style scores are scary, even though we were on the winning end.</p>
