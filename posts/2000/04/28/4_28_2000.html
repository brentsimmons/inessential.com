<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/imovie/">Apple releases iMovie for G4 Macs</a> as free download. It&#039;s about time.</p>

<p>Thomas Creedon <a href="http://editorial.inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$476">points out</a> that it <a href="http://www.maccentral.com/news/0004/28.imovieworks.shtml">works for other Macs</a>, too. Of course, I&#039;m a little selfish, I just care that I&#039;ll finally have an editor that runs on my G4.</p>
