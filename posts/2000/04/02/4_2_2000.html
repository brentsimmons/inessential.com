<p><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$524">Major outages</a> continue on our Conxion LAN -- though I suspect the problems are still with PacBell, not Conxion.</p>

<p><em>Update 5:00 p.m.:</em> Mariners win 3-2. Young pitcher Ryan Anderson was amazing. Sheila will have pictures of the game, once they&#039;re developed, including a shot of A-Rod as he&#039;s about to take his home run swing in the first inning.</p>

<p>I&#039;m off to the ball game -- <a href="http://www.mariners.org/">Mariners</a> vs. <a href="http://www.phillies.com/">Phillies</a>. The Phillie Phanatic will be there. It&#039;s like a dream come true!</p>

<p>The Seattle Times wrote on <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/here/">Friday</a>: "You might not want to party too late tomorrow night; the weekend is an hour shorter than usual." Of course, I ended up completely disregarding this advice. I&#039;m so glad it&#039;s Daylight Savings Time -- but I always hate missing that hour of sleep. Oh well, a small price to pay.</p>
