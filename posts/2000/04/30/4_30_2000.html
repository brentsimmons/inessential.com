<p><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/04/30">The move went well</a>. Small glitches, simple fixes.</p>

<p>Except for this one -- the hard drive on a DNS server in Seattle died. It just sits there clicking; the machine won&#039;t boot. It will be replaced Tuesday. Luckily, this doesn&#039;t affect things much, it just means we&#039;re down one DNS server for a couple days. Also luckily, this was the only service that machine was providing, so restoring the service won&#039;t be too difficult.</p>

<p>I did have the interesting experience of taking the cover off the machine, calling support, then holding the phone up to the hard drive so the support guy could hear the problem. He immediately told me that a technician would be out to replace it, he didn&#039;t ask me to try X or Y or Z.</p>
