<p>I named the plant Chief after <a href="http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com/u/baseball/mlb/players/player_21559.htm">Freddy Garcia</a>, Mariners starting pitcher. Chief was 17-8 last year, a great year for a rookie.</p>

<p>Jason Levine has released a <a href="http://q.queso.com/deepLeapPlugIn">DeapLeap Manila plug-in</a>.</p>

<p>Mariners beat the Blue Jays 17-6. Highlight: Edgar Martinez hits a grand slam -- his 200th career home run.</p>
