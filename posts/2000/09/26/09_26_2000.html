<p>Reminder: the Seattle Frontier User&#039;s Group <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$21532">meets tonight</a>. I&#039;ll be there!

<p>There are people who support a political party, Democrats or Republicans, almost as if it&#039;s a religion. I&#039;m not sure if these people can&#039;t or won&#039;t think for themselves.</p>

<p>I&#039;m one of those people.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>There is a small handful of hugely important issues that my party stands for. The other party vehemently disagrees.</p>

<p>It&#039;s not really religion on my part -- it&#039;s total pragmatism. My party could nominate a rock or a racoon or an oak tree -- and I&#039;d vote for it. Because that rock is going to be on my side of those issues.</p>

<p>I have never been disillusioned about politics, because I have never had any illusions. My earliest memories are of sitting at the dinner table and watching the Watergate hearings. I remember watching Nixon resign. <em>This was my first exposure to politics.</em> First impressions last.</p>

<p>I call it the Presumption of Nixon. I assume that every candidate for every office is no morally better than Nixon, I assume they have done or would do what Nixon did, or worse. I&#039;m continually surprised that people expect politicians to be better than that.</p>

<p>Given a choice between two evil jerk-off artists -- and given that that&#039;s the only choice you will ever have in a million years -- you vote for the one who agrees with you on the issues you most care about. It&#039;s the issues that matter.
