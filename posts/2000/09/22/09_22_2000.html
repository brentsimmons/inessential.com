<p>I just got my Mac OS X Beta CDs in the mail today. (Two CDs, the OS itself and developer tools.) I&#039;ll do the install sometime tonight. I might write about it. Or maybe not. Call me a moody bastard. Actually, I&#039;ve been looking forward to this for quite a while. Not so much for Aqua, which sounds like it needs work, but for the UNIX-ish foundation. To paraphrase <a href="http://www.redrival.com/miketown/characters.html#ANGUS%20and%20STUART">Mike Myers</a>: "If it&#039;s na&#039; UNIX it&#039;s crap."
