<p>There will be a Seattle Frontier Users Group Meeting <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$21532">next Tuesday</a>. I&#039;ll be there!

<p>I live in Ballard, Seattle&#039;s Norwegian neighborhood. (Sheila&#039;s maiden name is Erickson, and there&#039;s a statue of her ancestor Leif here.) But last night, at the local Walgreen&#039;s, we had a decidedly non-Norwegian experience. As I was fumbling with the debit machine, the clerk tells me -- "the machine is <em>meshuggeh</em>." Though not Jewish myself, I grew up on the east coast; New Jersey is my ancestral home. That is to say that Yiddish isn&#039;t a completely foreign language to me, and it&#039;s heart-warming to hear it spoken in this Scandinavian enclave.
