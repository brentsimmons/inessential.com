<p>I&#039;ve been re-reading <a href="http://www1.fatbrain.com/asp/bookinfo/bookinfo.asp?theisbn=1556155514">Writing Solid Code</a>, an excellent book about development practices. Highly recommended. Last night the book was reminding me to write very boring code. Don&#039;t rely on side effects. Functions should have clearly defined behavior.</p>

<p>In tone and in usefulness, this book reminds me of Strunk and White&#039;s <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=020530902X">The Elements of Style</a>, another book I like to re-read.</p>

<p>It may seem counter-intuitive, but both books are inspirational -- even though they&#039;re rule books, or books of guidelines. They get my juices flowing. Maybe because they take seriously the work I do all day without making the work seem heavy. They&#039;re <em>fun</em>.</p>

<p>Another thought -- I&#039;ve always been obsessed with aesthetics. I even have college credits in aesthetics. (I also have credits in interpretive dance, so take that with a grain of salt.) The books could be re-titled as The Aesthetics of Code and The Aesthetics of Prose. Without coming out and saying so, they teach you what beauty is in their respective art forms.</p>

<p>What&#039;s interesting are the common elements -- readability, clarity, precision.</p>

<p><a href="http://editorial.inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$870">Garret asked</a> if Writing Solid Code is useful to a moderate programmer who doesn&#039;t know C. Yes, absolutely, even though many of the examples are in C. You don&#039;t need to know C to understand what&#039;s going on. When I first read it, I applied it to my scripting work. I recommend this book for anybody doing Frontier or Radio UserLand scripting.</p>

<p>It was originally recommended to me by <a href="http://scripting.com/">Dave</a>. One of the first things I did when I started working at UserLand was read this book.
