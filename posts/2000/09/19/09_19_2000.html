<p>I&#039;ve been fixing bugs like mad today. I&#039;m one of those types who loves fixing bugs. Bringing new features to the people is cool -- but sometimes fixing bugs is more thrilling.</p>

<p>Some of these bugs are Radio UserLand specific, others are in the kernel shared by Frontier and Radio UserLand.
