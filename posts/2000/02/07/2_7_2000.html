<p>NetDyslexia: <a href="http://netdyslexia.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$88">How to Make a Popular Weblog</a>. Don&#039;t miss this story. Better yet, link to it from your own weblog.</p>

<p>I didn&#039;t realize it, but with over 3,000 reads, <a href="http://miner.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$6">this page</a> has to be one of the most popular EditThisPage.Com pages.</p>

<p><a href="http://viewfromtheheart.editthispage.com/2000/02/06">ViewFromTheHeart</a> writes about the power of Heinlein novels to inspire and teach kids. Me, I&#039;m still getting inspired, still learning, even on the nth re-reading.</p>

<p>***Linux stuff</p>

<p>Is there a Linux-programmers-newbies site? For people new to developing in C and C++ on and for Linux, not new to programming in general. Is there a Linux developers magazine, something like <a href="http://mactech.com/">MacTech</a>?</p>

<p>What&#039;s a good POP server for Linux? I bought this <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=1565922220">big book on sendmail</a>, which I need in any case, but apparently sendmail isn&#039;t also a POP server. No problem. So what do people use? <em>Update 12:15 p.m.:</em> Andr√© suggests <a href="http://www.nodomainname.net/software/mailutils/">pop3d</a>.</p>

<p>Martin Spernau <a href="http://inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$137">suggests</a> that a driver could allow any Linux tool to access a Frontier database.</p>

<p>Apple&#039;s got a page on <a href="http://ppclinux.apple.com/">Linux for Macs</a>. Cool, but I wish Mac OS X were Linux-based.</p>

<p>***Baseball</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnnsi.com/baseball/mlb/news/2000/02/05/hunter_money/index.html">Brian Hunter gets a $700,000 raise</a>, arbitrators rule. That&#039;s a little nutty: the guy didn&#039;t even hit .250.</p>

<p>In other baseball news, <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/news/sports/html98/ston_20000206.html">no deal yet for Griffey</a>. Note to whoever ends up with Griffey: he&#039;s a great player, but an undisputed head case, a prima donna. What&#039;s worse, he&#039;s so-so at stealing, lousy at sliding, uneven at bunting, doesn&#039;t hit much better than .300 in a good year, and tends to choke at the bat in late innings. Trade him already. (Okay, he does everything else better than anyone else alive, but still.)</p>

<p>I&#039;m at the point where I&#039;d rather see <a href="http://media.mariners.org/players/Player_data_obj.asp?playerid=32">Charles Gipson</a> in center field. He&#039;s no Griffey, but he&#039;s an exciting player with lots of speed and a good glove -- and he&#039;s grateful, as any pro should be, to just be in the show. From Griffey we&#039;ve endured a few years of the-fans-take-me-for-granted talk, which just blows my mind. You won&#039;t hear that from Gipson.</p>

<p>Maybe you have to be just my age to understand. I left college in the very early &#039;90s, in the Bush years, when the country was in a deep recession. (Remember?) Some analysts were starting to use the word depression. I was grateful to get a job at all, I didn&#039;t mind so much that I was a 20-something busboy, clearing tables in seafood restaurants. The intervening years of prosperity have not changed my attitude: if you&#039;re doing well, if you&#039;ve earned some privilege, you should show some respect to the people who paid for it, who helped you get there.</p>
