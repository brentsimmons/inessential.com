<p><a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$3157">Scripting Manila</a>. Today we released system.verbs.apps.Manila -- Manila is a scriptable application. Also see today&#039;s <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/02/21">Scripting News</a>.</p>

<p>Sheila just got us tickets to the April 2nd exhibition game between the Mariners and the Phillies. Safeco field, 100 level, row 20, between home plate and first base, behind the home team dugout. Wow! I haven&#039;t been to a Phillies game in many, many years. I&#039;m excited!</p>
