<p>***Griffey traded</p>

<p>It&#039;s official: <a href="http://cnnsi.com/baseball/mlb/news/2000/02/10/griffey_trade_ap/">Griffey traded to Reds</a>.</p>

<p>We&#039;re not getting Jim Edmonds from the Angels -- I&#039;m very glad of that. We&#039;re getting center fielder Mike Cameron, pitcher Brett Tomko, and two prospects from the Reds. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if we turn around and deal some of the players to other teams, though I suspect we&#039;ll keep Mike Cameron, as we need a center fielder.</p>

<p>I&#039;m sad, of course. But I also feel sorry for the people of Cleveland. Griffey&#039;s a superstar, the Michael Jackson of baseball. He was a child star, a star before he even turned 20. He was raised in the major leagues -- Ken Griffey, Sr. played baseball, and is now the bench coach of the Reds. Griffey has never had anything like a normal life; there&#039;s no way he can identify with any fans. He likes children, and children only, refusing to sign autographs for adults. His nicknames: Junior, the Kid.</p>

<p>Two things will happen:</p>

<p>1) Griffey will become disgruntled again. It&#039;s what prima donnas excel at, being unhappy. <em>People don&#039;t love them enough.</em> Having a disgruntled superstar is a special brand of hell I wouldn&#039;t wish on anybody. But when that day comes, I will indulge in a little Schadenfreude, and I will laugh.</p>

<p>2) Griffey&#039;s deficiences will become apparent. He does not hit home runs in the 9th inning to win ball games. I believe he&#039;s done that just once in his entire career. In late innings he strikes out or, at best, walks. He&#039;s only so-so at small ball: every time he slides (which is rare) he looks like he&#039;s going to break his legs. He can do some things very, very well, better than just about anybody -- but he&#039;s not magic, he&#039;s got some serious flaws you might not know about unless you&#039;ve seen him as often as Mariners fans have.</p>

<p>I&#039;ve had enough of superstars in baseball: I&#039;d rather field a team of above-average players with heart and respect and a will to win. Superstars suck all the oxygen out of the air.</p>

<p><a href="http://howard.editthispage.com/2000/02/09">Howard&#039;s Musings</a>: "I attended the last game Griffey played in Seattle. He made one great catch in center. He didn&#039;t hit any home runs. I, and thousands of others, paid special attention when he came up to the plate in the eighth for his final at bat."</p>
