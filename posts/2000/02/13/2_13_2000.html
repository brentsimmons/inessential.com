<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/369556.asp">&#039;Peanuts&#039; creator Schulz dies at 77</a>. I wish he was just missing, like Snoopy in that one show, and he could come home again. There&#039;s more info on specials and tributes at <a href="http://www.peanuts.com">Peanuts.Com</a>.</p>

<p>Just for jazz, I downloaded and installed <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/release-notes/">Mozilla Milestone 13</a> last night. Progress! I can see that it may eventually turn into a browser one might want to use. The display engine seemed pretty fast. A huge number of UI bugs remain, enough to make it unusable for every day browsing. (For me, anyway.) In the half-hour or so I used it, it didn&#039;t crash. I&#039;m excited by the idea that one day we may have a browser with better standards compliance than IE 5 -- IE 5 is far from perfect, but it sure beats the current released versions of Navigator.</p>
