<p>MSNBC: <a href="http://msnbc.com/news/369807.asp">Bush wins South Carolina primary</a>. My take: SC was a "gimme" state for Bush. Let&#039;s see what happens Tuesday in Michigan.</p>

<p>Btw -- I&#039;m a McCain fan. While I&#039;d never vote for him in November, and I&#039;d probably never vote for any Republican ever, he seems so far to have Presidential character. And Dubya doesn&#039;t.</p>
