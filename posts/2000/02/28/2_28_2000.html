<p><a href="http://www.inessential.com/sheila/">Sheila</a> has a cold. She&#039;s sleeping mostly -- but she&#039;d rather be weblogging. Get well soon messages go to sjsimmons@ranchero.com or her <a href="http://www.inessential.com/sheila/discuss/">discussion group</a>. Thanks!</p>

<p>My <a href="http://www.inessential.com/mjdavis/">Mom</a> now has a Manila site. She&#039;s a software engineer at Boeing -- but not working due to the SPEEA strike. Here&#039;s Mom&#039;s resum√©: <a href="http://www.inessential.com/mjdavis/stories/storyReader$4">Software Engineer Extraordinaire</a>. "Seeking new challenges in the development of applications based on web and database enabled technologies, especially with the use of XML." Some things run in the family! But seriously: her experience goes back to the &#039;70s and she has an M.S. in Computer Science.</p>

<p>Don&#039;t miss <a href="http://upgradenow.3av.com/cgi-bin/framed/2312/main.html">Upgrade Now</a> -- the argument between Mad Hatter and Mr. Peepers is hilarious. Not sure if it&#039;s real or not. If it is, it&#039;s even funnier.</p>

<p>Perfect attendance! I dreamt last night I was in <a href="http://www.ccps.org/ccps/ehs/titlepage/titlepage.html">high school</a> and had perfect attendance. If you knew me then, you&#039;d be laughing. I was always on some kind of report -- I had very nearly the worst attendance in my school of 1300+ students. I got straight D&#039;s -- except in AP English, where I got straight A&#039;s. In other words, I got the education of a highly literate busboy. But now my dreams are trying to re-write my personal history.</p>

<p>How long ago was high school for me? When the fellow Seattle-ite who does <a href="http://velocity.editthispage.com/">velocity.editthispage.com</a> was being born. Back in my day we didn&#039;t have Manila, or even computers (at school) -- we had typewriters and the school newspaper.</p>
