<p>Jon Udell, in a post on O&#039;Reilly&#039;s discussion group: <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/cgi-bin/conf/item?group=oreillynet.linux&item=6">the web /is/ the platform</a>. "There is now an overarching framework, and it isn&#039;t one OS or another,

it&#039;s a fabric of network services involving servers, middleware, and

clients."</p>

<p>My Windows 98 machine has been getting progressively sicker. Today I lost three things: 1) the ability to shut down or restart from the Start menu, 2) the ability to do View Source on a web page, and 3) the ability to save a graphic from a web page to disk as anything other than a .bmp file. I&#039;m upgrading to Windows 2000 tonight; I hope it helps.</p>

<p>Spam can be funny. One I received today begins, "Are You Tired of Spending Countless Hours Searching for Pictures of Nude Celebrities?" Oh, geez, am I ever! So tired, so many hours. If I had a nickel for every hour I&#039;ve spent, I&#039;d have... well, $0.00. But that&#039;s beside the point. The email continues, "Well The Search is Over!!!!!!" The writer is clearly enthusiastic for his or her subject.</p>

<p>It&#039;s a slow news day. But you can relax, I don&#039;t expect to vent about Griffey. Why should I? He&#039;s a Red. &#039;s over.</p>
