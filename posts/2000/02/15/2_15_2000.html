<p>Wendi Dunlap of <a href="http://www.slumberland.org/">slumberland.org</a> once helped me out in a big way -- but I seriously doubt she would remember. It was around the time of the first Netscape betas, and I got a PPP account with Seanet, a local ISP. I was finally switching from my shell account with Eskimo. But I couldn&#039;t get a PPP connection with my Mac. I struggled for nearly a week. Finally I ended up talking to Wendi, Mac user and Seanet employee, who walked me through configuring MacTCP, when no one else there could help me.</p>
