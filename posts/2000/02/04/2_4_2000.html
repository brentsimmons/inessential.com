<p>I&#039;m working on Manila and Pike today, taking a break from Linux Frontier for a few days.</p>

<p>One of my favorite sources for news is <a href="http://salonherringwiredfool.com">SalonHerringWiredFool.Com</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://home.cnet.com/category/0-1003-200-1541952.html">Windows Me</a>? Something about this name makes me want to say: "Windows you, buddy." Or: "Yeah, I got your Windows <em>right here</em>." But I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll say either of those things.</p>

<p>I added a discuss link to the navigation. I added a search link a couple days ago. One of the things I&#039;m working on is making it easy for Manila sites to have a search page. This site is my guinea pig. The way it works now is not how it will work finally.</p>
