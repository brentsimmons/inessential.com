<p>Sheila <a href="http://www.inessential.com/sheila/2000/02/08">found the words</a> to talk about the Griffey saga.</p>

<p>Sam DeVore&#039;s <a href="http://scidzone.editthispage.com/">scidZone</a> aims to be a resource for Manila users. "Welcome to the template place."</p>

<p>Scott Hanson <a href="http://inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$138">asks</a> if anyone else is running Frontier under WINE. <a href="http://inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$142">Eric Soroos</a> is, but without success so far.</p>

<p>Daniel Berlinger posts more <a href="http://inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$146">links</a> regarding CERT&#039;s ferocious markup advisory.</p>

<p>I got some email about my statement that I wished Mac OS X were Linux-based. The gist of it was that it didn&#039;t matter, since Mac OS X should be able to run PPC Linux binaries. But here&#039;s one thing (out of many things) I wonder about: will I be able to install the same software that runs on my LinuxPPC machine? What I do is go to the <a href="ftp://ftp.linuxppc.com/linuxppc-1999/RedHat/RPMS/">LinuxPPC FTP server</a>, download an RPM, type rpm -Uvh whatever-it-is, and it&#039;s installed. It doesn&#039;t seem likely that I could do this with Mac OS X. Maybe I&#039;m wrong? <a href="http://inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$143">Discussion continues</a>...</p>

<p>Nicole Yates: <a href="http://phillyfuture.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$104">The Philly Sports Fan&#039;s Mystique</a>. Though I&#039;m a Seattle-ite, I was raised a Philly sports fan. Still am -- see my comments on Griffey <a href="http://inessential.com/2000/02/07">yesterday</a>.</p>

<p>LinuxNewbies on <a href="http://linuxnewbies.editthispage.com/dnt/20000208">man pages</a>. "Foo and bar, in my view, are the bane of the inexperienced user&#039;s existence. The use of these two metaphorical examples don&#039;t tell users anything useful." Nuts -- I use foo and bar (and sometimes baz) all the time. I never thought to question it.</p>

<p>I got on Usenet today for the first time in years. I&#039;ve subscribed to the WINE newsgroup and a few Linux/UNIX groups. I used to use NewsWatcher on my Mac, now I&#039;m using Outlook Express on Windows. Whatever. My first reader was tin (I think), back when my Internet access was through a dial-up shell account. Jay R. Ashworth suggests I try <a href="http://www.forteinc.com/agent/freagent.htm">FreeAgent</a>.</p>

<p>Lots of good stuff today on <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/qube/">QubeQuorner</a>, and <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/linux/">O&#039;Reilly</a>.</p>

<p>I asked yesterday about a POP server for Linux. Mark Staben wrote to suggest I use the servers that come with <a href="http://www.washington.edu/pine/">Pine</a>.</p>
