Yesterday we published an <a href="https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/episode/andrea-mcvittie-user-experience-designer">episode with Andrea McVittie</a>, User Experience Designer at The Omni Group.

Andrea will brook nae interference with the puppies. Be nice!

She also talks a bit about how design works at Omni and about design and ethics. After we posted the episode, she followed up with a tweet where she <a href="https://twitter.com/amcvittie/status/938486898435035136">codifies her ethical guidelines</a>.

Recently Omni created a Slack group — <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/slack/">you can join up</a>.

It’s not intended as a replacement for support. But you can talk with Omni people and with other people who use Omni apps. It’s not super-busy; it’s, well, <em>nice</em>. I like having the people who use the things we work on so nearby.
