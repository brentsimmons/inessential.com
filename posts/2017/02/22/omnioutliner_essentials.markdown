Omni <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/introducing-omnioutliner-essentials-an-outliner-for-everyone">introduces OmniOutliner Essentials</a>:

>We didn’t want to just reach out to our existing audience; we wanted to introduce the joys and benefits of outlining to a much larger audience. We decided that meant two things: we needed to make the app much simpler, and we needed to make it much more affordable.

It’s in public preview now. <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner/preview/essentials">You can check it out</a>.

I’ve been the junior developer on the OmniOutliner team for a couple years, and it’s a joy to work on an app that I’ve loved for years as a user. We’re not finished yet with this release, but I’m very happy with how it’s turning out.

PS I like that Ken mentions MORE in the blog post:

>We shipped the first beta of OmniOutliner while Mac OS X was still in beta, and doing so introduced us to a passionate community of outliners who had been using great outlining tools like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MORE_(application)">MORE</a> for over a decade.

MORE was by Living Videotext, which was <a href="http://scripting.com">Dave Winer</a>’s company. Later I went to work at Dave’s company UserLand Software, which also included an outliner in its app Frontier, which I worked on. So there is a sort-of family tree connection from OmniOutliner back to MORE.
