My pals at CocoaConf asked me to remind you that the <a href="https://twitter.com/cocoaconf/status/852898192035282944">Early Bird sale ends in two weeks</a> for CocoaConf Next Door — the one taking place in San Jose during WWDC.

I’ll be there. At least in the afternoons.

Check out the <a href="http://cocoaconf.com/nextdoor/speakers">speakers list</a>. Yummy, chewy, nutty speakers list.
