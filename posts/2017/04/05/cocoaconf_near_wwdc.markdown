There are a bunch of things happening near WWDC this year. Me, I’ll be at <a href="http://cocoaconf.com/blog/nextdoor">CocoaConf Next Door</a>. I’m not preparing a talk, but I’ll probably be on a panel. And hanging out.

Check out the <a href="http://cocoaconf.com/nextdoor/speakers">speakers list</a>, which includes Omni’s own <a href="http://cocoaconf.com/nextdoor/speakers/162">Liz Marley</a>. And a bunch of other people you totally want to see — Manton Reece, Jean MacDonald, Laura Savino, and plenty more.

Also… <a href="http://altconf.com/">AltConf</a> and <a href="https://layers.is/">Layers</a> will be near WWDC. If you could be in three places at once, you would. Well, four, including WWDC itself, I suppose. :)
