On Wednesday night I know where I’ll be — playing keyboard for a few songs at the James Dempsey and the Breakpoints concert benefitting App Camp for Girls.

<a href="https://www.classy.org/events/-/e126329">You should get tickets</a>. It’s a fun time for a great cause.

Bonus: James writes about how <a href="http://jamesdempsey.net/2017/06/02/wwdc-in-san-jose-full-circle/">this concert is full circle for him</a>. It’s a special night.
