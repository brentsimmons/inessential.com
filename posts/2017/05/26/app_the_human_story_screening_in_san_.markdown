Here’s the <a href="https://medium.com/altconf/altconf-layers-present-app-the-human-story-3c2b3cb8fc4c">scoop</a>. It’s Sunday, June 4 at 5 pm. There’s a panel afterward with a bunch of people from the movie (including me).

<a href="https://www.classy.org/san-jose/events/app-human-story-documentary-screening-presented-by-altconf-layers/e128096">You can get tickets</a>. You *should* get tickets — the event benefits <a href="http://appcamp4girls.com/">App Camp for Girls</a>.

Plus I think you’ll enjoy it. :)
