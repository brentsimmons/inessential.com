<a href="https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/episode/brian-covey-support-manager">New episode is up</a>!

Brian is the Support Manager at The Omni Group, and he has a bunch to say about how support — and the Support Humans — work at Omni, including how they’re involved with product decisions, and how we came to offer phone support.

DVD extras content: a video from 2006 of <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/Yes_-_The_Omni_Video">Brian doing the worm</a>. Unmissable.
