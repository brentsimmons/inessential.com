I’m the host of a new podcast: <a href="https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/">The Omni Show</a>. Here’s the <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/the-omni-show-debuts">announcement on the Omni blog</a> with all the details. There’s a Twitter account, <a href="https://twitter.com/theomnishow">@theomnishow</a>, you can follow.

I’m super-excited to be doing this, partly because my co-workers at Omni are interesting, and partly because some of it may actually be *useful* — that is, learning how we think about UX, testing, engineering, support, and so on might be helpful for other people. That’s my hope.

Our first episode is with <a href="https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/episode/kristina-sontag-software-test-manager">Kristina Sontag</a>, Software Test Manager, and the second episode is with <a href="https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/episode/curt-clifton-omnifocus-engineer">Curt Clifton</a>, OmniFocus engineer. The next two episodes will feature support and UX. We’re covering all the bases. :)

I’ve done podcasts before (see <a href="http://identicalcousins.net/">Identical Cousins</a> and <a href="http://therecord.co/">The Record</a>), so I’m not completely new to this. It’s produced by Mark Boszko, also a podcast veteran, who does <a href="http://opticalpodcast.com/">The Optical</a>, which is a must-listen for everybody who likes movies. The music is by <a href="https://cherof.bandcamp.com/">Aaron Cherof</a>, composer <i>extraordinaire</i>, and the look of the site is by <a href="https://twitter.com/zombiehat">Kaitlin Reiss</a>. My favorite touch is the big “THE OMNI SHOW” title at the top — <a href="https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/">watch it</a> as the gradient slowly changes. It’s mesmerizing.

And, of course, there are more people working on the show. Like everything else, it’s a team effort, but it goes to the theme of the show (“The Omni Show is people!”) to mention some specific individuals — and to thank them. Thank you to everyone who works on The Omni Show.
