<p><a href="http://samples.userland.com/stories/storyReader$67">isp.root</a> makes it easy to host lots of Manila sites. I&#039;m looking forward to seeing the first non-UserLand Manila ISP.</p>

<p>I just <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaNewbies/discuss/msgReader$1086">fixed</a> automatic shortcuts for stories in Manila sites.</p>

<p>

I need to make this site searchable before I actually start adding content to it. Luckily (perhaps), this is a general problem I&#039;m facing -- lots of Manila users want to make their site searchable. This may (or may not) happen before the turn of the millennium.</p>

<p>I like <a href="http://www.linuxppc.com/">LinuxPPC</a> very much -- my one Linux box is a LinuxPPC box, an old Mac 8500. But I wonder if Yellow Dog Linux might have been the better choice for servers. Check out the list of <a href="http://www.yellowdoglinux.com/resources/databases.shtml">databases</a> that come installed with Yellow Dog. <em>Too late to change now -- but I have another Mac server I&#039;m slowly working on "retiring" to Linux.</em></p>
