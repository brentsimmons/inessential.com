<p>It&#039;s a geek&#039;s Christmas! Since <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/changes/61">Frontier 6.1</a> shipped, now that I have a half-dozen minutes of spare time in a day, I ordered some new reading material which arrived today. <a href="http://www.ora.com/">O&#039;Reilly</a> books: sendmail, Linux in a Nutshell, and Perl in a Nutshell.</p>

<p>Dave Winer in <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1996/10/11/MarciaMarciaMarcia">Marcia Marcia Marcia</a> (October 1996): "Whenever I ship I get a new keyboard and mouse. It improves my feelings about the computer tremendously. I type with authority. I click with real feeling!"</p>
