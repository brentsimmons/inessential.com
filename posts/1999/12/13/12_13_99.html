<p>New Manila feature -- <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaNewbies/stories/storyReader$824">Navigation Customization</a>. I&#039;m using it on this site, though just to make the navigation links plain text rather than bold. (I tried horizontal navigation links but it was hard to come up with a template I liked.)</p>

<p>Jason Levine&#039;s <a href="http://queso.editthispage.com/">q</a> weblog is the first site I found to take advantage of the new feature. Jason&#039;s doing a lot with appearance, and that&#039;s one of the top Manila priorities.</p>
