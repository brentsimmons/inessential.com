<p>We just added a new feature to Manila -- <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaNewbies/stories/storyReader$708">multiple news days</a> on the home page. It&#039;s in use (obviously) on this site.</p>

<p>Just between you and me, I think this feature is stunning, one of the most powerful yet easy and fun features in Manila.</p>

<p>Lots more features to come...</p>
