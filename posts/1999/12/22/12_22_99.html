<p><a href="http://www.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$19">A holiday gift from UserLand</a> -- hosting EditThisPage.Com sites created in 1999 indefinitely. This is an example of why I work for UserLand and wouldn&#039;t want to work anywhere else. Generosity is key.</p>

<p>I remembered last night that I actually have a shrink-wrapped copy of <a href="http://www.caldera.com/openstore/openlinux/">Caldera OpenLinux 2.3</a>. I wondered if it was easy to create a dual-boot machine, Windows and Linux, so I could have a Linux workstation that&#039;s purely for play. It turns out that OpenLinux comes with an actual manual (!), and according to the manual it&#039;s super-easy to set up a dual-boot machine. So I&#039;m going to. I&#039;ll probably write up my experience here.</p>

<p>I&#039;m so freakin&#039; desperate for a decent browser on my Mac that I&#039;m going to try <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/release-notes/">Mozilla Milestone 12</a>. <em>Update:</em> It may be the dogfood release, but it&#039;s not my dogfood, and I can&#039;t eat it. It&#039;s slow. Page up and page down buttons don&#039;t work. Etc. I&#039;ll try again when M13 comes out.</p>
