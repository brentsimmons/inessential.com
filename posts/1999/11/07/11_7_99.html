<p>All about <a href="http://www.squirrels.org/">squirrels</a>.</p>

<p>Squirrel <a href="http://www.htcomp.net/weis/sqphilosophy.html">philosophy</a>: "We don&#039;t care where the nuts came from, let&#039;s just play with them." If squirrels ran their own web site, would it be about squirrels or would it be about nuts?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.libraries.psu.edu/iasweb/nabokov/zembla.htm">Zembla</a> is dedicated to the works of Vladimir Nabokov. I&#039;ve read Pnin, Lolita, and Speak, Memory, but I&#039;ve yet to read Pale Fire (from which the name Zembla comes, I believe). Perhaps before the end of the millenium?</p>
