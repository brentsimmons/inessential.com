I missed the Voices that Matter iPhone developers conference last year in Boston — but I heard great things about it, and I ended up being sad I missed it.

Then just recently I heard the <a href="http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/iphone2010/">next one is in <em>Seattle</em></a>, which is where I live. Not going to miss it this time, no way. :)

Let me get the money thing out of the way: use the discount code PHBLOGS when registering to save $100. <a href="http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/iphone2010/register.aspx">Register before March 12</a> for early-bird pricing to save another $200. That’s <strong>$300</strong> total, ’kay?

#### About the conference

It’s put on by our friends at Addison-Wesley — the idea is that the speakers are the folks who literally wrote the books on iPhone development. Folks like <a href="http://twitter.com/AaronHillegass">Aaron Hillegass</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/rentzsch">Jonathan <strong>Wolf</strong> Rentzsch</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/Eddienull">Kevin Avila</a>, and <a href="http://iphone2010.crowdvine.com/calendar">more</a>.

Aaron Hillegass, by the way, taught a ton of people Cocoa programming <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/">in person</a> — and the ones he didn’t teach in person he <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/book/cocoa®_programming_for_mac®_os_x_3rd_edition">taught by way of his Cocoa book</a>. Me included. Aaron is responsible for just about everything and everybody.

I’ve seen him talk — and he’s <em>so</em> damn good.

#### About Seattle

Have you been to Seattle? It’s beautiful. Green. Lush. Alive. Waters fresh and salty plus two nearby mountain ranges plus a view of the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/mora/">tallest mountain</a> in the lower 48 states.

The conference is on the waterfront at the Bell Harbor conference center. I’ve been to two Gnomedex conferences twice at that same location — it’s very nice, with a view of downtown, the waterfront, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Bay">Elliot Bay</a>, and the <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&source=hp&q=olympic+mountains&gbv=2&aq=0&oq=olympic+mount&aqi=g3g-sx1g1g-m1">Olympic mountains</a>.

The conference hotel is the Edgewater. The Beatles stayed there in like 1964 or something. In those days they used to give you fishing poles so you could fish from your hotel room.

#### About the Seattle Cocoa community

I don’t know who all of the locals are going. (I hope they all are.)

You might even wonder if there <em>are</em> any locals. Seattle’s gotta be a Microsoft town, right?

But here in the shadow of Mordor we’ve got a pretty hot bunch of developers. By way of proof I could just mention the magic kingdom of <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/">Omni</a> and be done.

But there’s also the cool cats at <a href="http://www.roguesheep.com/">Rogue Sheep</a>, the amazing <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/">Flying Meat</a> (Gus Mueller), <a href="http://www.rhonabwy.com/wp/">Joe Heck</a> (ringleader), some <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/gregrobbins">Cocoa-y Google</a> folks, the madmen at <a href="http://blackpixel.com/">Black Pixel Luminance</a>, the unclassifiably hip <a href="http://corporationunknown.com/blog/">Corporation Unknown</a>, Professor <a href="http://halmueller.wordpress.com/">Hal Mueller</a>, the artisans at <a href="http://zumobi.com/">Zumobi</a>, and plenty more.

#### After hours

I’m thinking <a href="http://www.shortydog.com/tour.html">pinball at Shorty’s</a>. (Not like it’s the only place in town. But don’t us geeks love pinball? And it’s walking distance — just up the hill from the Edgewater.)

Anyway, that’s the scoop. Come to <em>my</em> neck of the woods for a change, wouldja?
