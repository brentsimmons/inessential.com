I got email asking me if I was doing some kind of public shunning of <a href="http://twitter.com/eridius">Kevin Ballard</a>. By no means! He’s a totally great guy — smart, friendly, funny, way more interesting than I was at his age — and I’m sorry I didn’t see him at Macworld. It’s just that 1) he’s fun to tease and 2) he’s a super-good sport.

My kind of fella.

Now pretend you didn’t read all of the above. :)
