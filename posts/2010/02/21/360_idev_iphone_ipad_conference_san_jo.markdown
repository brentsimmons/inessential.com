Going to the <a href="http://www.360idev.com/">360 iDev iPhone conference</a>?

I am. I’m speaking, even, on the topic of content-based apps. (On feeds, XML parsing, performance, networking, the beauty of NSOperationQueue, image caching and scaling, SQLite and Core Data, etc.)

I went last year to the San Jose conference and then to 360 iDev in Denver. Had a great time both times and totally look forward to this conference.

The iPad should actually be out by then, which is cool — I don’t know exactly what iPad content is lined up, but I have to figure lots of speakers will incorporate iPad into their presentations. And I bet lots of folks will bring iPads with them. I want to go just to see a whole bunch of people’s iPad apps and ideas.

I think it’s the first iPad conference with actual iPads. That’s <strong>kind of like Woodstock</strong>, right? I don’t want you to say you were there when you weren’t really there — you should actually <em>be</em> there.

Not enough? Here are some other randomly-jotted notes, then...

- It’s near Cupertino. One night we all go over to Steve Jobs’s house for barbeque and Cuban cigars. It’s totally chill. (Wait. Okay. Maybe not. But it <em>is</em> near Cupertino, though.)

- Last year I almost got in a fight at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/lindas-light-rail-lounge-san-jose">Linda’s Light Rail Lounge</a>. Lesson learned: <em>don’t ever joke about NASCAR with somebody who cares</em>. He said he liked so-and-so as a great driver, I said something about Jeff Gordon (the only driver’s name I know) — and apparently the guy thought Jeff Gordon was a sissy or something. I had to talk fast. It’s possible that I bought him a drink, or maybe <a href="http://twitter.com/metafy">Joe</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/burcaw">Dan</a> handled it and saved me.

	What I mean is this: you and me, we should hang out.

- My friends <a href="http://twitter.com/bradellis">Brad Ellis</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/dwiskus">Dave Wiskus</a> — great designers — are doing a co-presentation on something designer-y-ish.

	Don’t know who they are?

	Check out some apps Brad’s worked on: Apple Design Award winner <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/postage-postcards/id312231322?mt=8">Postage</a>, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id335201876?mt=8">Word Spin</a>, and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snoglobe/id344579002?mt=8">SnoGlobe</a>.

	And check out apps Dave’s worked on: <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coathangr/id324900406?mt=8">Coathangr</a> and the wickedly addicting <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/typewar/id350633756?mt=8">Typewar</a>.

- Oh, whatever, shut up, at least it’s <a href="http://siliconvalley.citysearch.com/profile/1099212/san_jose_ca/denny_s.html">always open</a>.

- <a href="http://twitter.com/mzarra">Marcus Zarra</a> will be there. And speaking. Don’t miss your chance to hear from the double-fisted wizard of Cores both Data and Animation.

- <a href="http://collindonnell.com/">Colin Donnell</a> will be speaking. He has great hair and brains to match.

- I sometimes judge a conference by who I met and keep in touch with. Last year I met <a href="http://twitter.com/ryannielsen">Ryan Nielsen</a> and the previously-mentioned Dan Burcaw.

- In fact, the conference has such great mojo that last year Dave Wiskus was in town — for other reasons, only coincidentally in San Jose — but he hung out with us at night. And a year later he’s a successful indie iPhone developer and a speaker at 360 iDev. Imagine if he had actually <em>attended</em> the conference. He’d probably be an App Store billionaire by now. (Which is just $150 million in regular money, but still nothing to sneeze at.)

	(That App Store money thing didn’t make any sense. Sorry.)

	What I’m saying is: this conference has the power to launch entire careers!

- Check out the <a href="http://www.360idev.com/speakers">entire list of speakers</a>. Julio will be there! Joe-with-the-hat! More! It’s a great line-up.

- <a href="http://www.taplynx.com/">TapLynx</a> is a sponsor. That means, yes, we’re paying for some of your fun and awesome learnings. :)

- It’ll be months before WWDC. Hard to wait, right? Especially with all this cool iPad grooviness.

Anyway... <a href="http://www.360idev.com/">you should go to the website</a> and check it out. Here’s the <a href="http://360idev.eventbrite.com/?ref=ebtn">registration page</a>.

Also, they might set up Rock Band again. You haven’t lived till you’ve seen Joe Pezzillo do No Sleep Till Brooklyn. You can hope.
