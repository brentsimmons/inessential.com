<a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/wiki/index.php?title=Release_Notes">Release Notes - Things Wiki</a>: “Added support for emptying the Trash immediately. Hold down the option key while choosing the ‘Empty Trash...’ menu command.”

Thank you to my long-lost cousin <a href="http://twitter.com/macguitar">Michael Simmons</a> and the fine folks at <a href="http://culturedcode.com/">Cultured Code</a> for catering to my psychotic computing needs!

I can’t have stuff in the Trash. If I do, then it’s a thing I have to do. So I empty it right away, since it’s easy. But not easy enough — there was a confirmation sheet. Now I can hold down option and bypass the confirmation sheet.

“Well, Brent,” you might ask, “how often do you trash stuff in Things?”

<em>Every time</em>, is the answer. I never mark stuff as done. No. Must get rid of right away. I did a thing, it’s out of my life, good-bye, don’t want no log, don’t want to look back and remember the glory days of five minutes ago when I did that thing.

So I empty the trash after every task I accomplish.

And now it’s friction-free. So happy.

P.S. After so many years of GUI computing, I have yet to adapt to any Trash can thing anywhere. Not in the Finder either. (Especially not there.) I’ve given up any hope that I can change on this matter.

<em>Maybe</em>, I like to reassure myself, <em>it’ll be okay. In the long run</em>.
