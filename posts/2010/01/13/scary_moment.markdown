My iPhone developer and distribution certificates were going to expire in two days. But right now, tonight, was a good time to renew them, given my plans for the next couple days.

Well I couldn’t figure it out. There’s nothing about <em>renewing</em>. That I could find anyway.

Finally, the only thing left to do was click the scary Revoke button. The idea being that I could revoke the current certificates and <em>then</em> I’d be able to upload my certificate signing requests and get new ones. (I saved my signing requests from last year.)

But, really, <em>Revoke</em>? I’m going to click <em>that</em>? Are you <em>insane</em>?

Will the Revoke button ban me forever? End my career as an iPhone developer? Will I have to go back to busing tables? 

Will I be a broken-down drunk a month from now, remembering every night when I clicked that damn Revoke button, bothering everyone in the bar for free drinks and a chance to tell my story of how I used to be on the inside?

“I could write <em>code</em>, man, for iPhones, I used to <em>be</em> somebody, and then I made a mistake on the program portal, just a little mistake. It said <em>revoke</em>, I know, I <em>know</em>, why oh why did I ever click that thing? Well. I’ll gladly pay you Tuesday for a whiskey today.”

I thought of all that, then screwed my courage to the sticking-place, cranked up the Pogues, and clicked.

...

You still there? Am I still here?
