<a href="http://adventuresinnewfield.blogspot.com/2010/01/aside-about-apples-new-ipad-it-is-about.html">Adventures in Newfield</a> (my Mom): “Most of the media reports don’t seem to get the new iPad — it’s not about how fast it is, or its lack of a camera or the flash to display video — it’s about using it just about anywhere and not needing a mouse!”

Mom wants one. Me too. :)
