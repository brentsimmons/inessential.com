I’m totally looking forward to the first <a href="http://www.360macdev.com/">360 MacDev</a>. I’ve been to every 360 iDev (iPhone/iPad) conference, and they’re fantastic conferences.

Unlike 360 iDev, MacDev is a single-track conference. The <a href="http://www.360macdev.com/schedule/">schedule starts with Mike Lee</a> doing “Dirty Jokes and Code” — hopefully in his pirate suit — and includes speakers Justin Williams, Marcus Zarra, Dave Wiskus, Kyle Richter, Michael Simmons, and more. One of the topics I’m most interested in Saul Mora’s talk “MacRuby and You,” and of course things like networking, Core Data, UI design, and marketing are covered too.

It’s in downtown Denver this December. (My company NewsGator is in Denver, and I visit several times a year, and so I can assure you that we’ll not lack for entertainment in the evenings. Fun town.)

The big thing for me, though, is that the Mac developer community is about to change in a big way, with the Mac App Store opening soon. This is the last chance to get together before the change — it’s like seeing your favorite band right before they sign with a major record label. (Only we’re also the band.) I hope to see you there!
