Over the weekend I had the luxury of working on some code that is 10.6-and-up-only and runs only on 64-bit Intel processors. I turned on Garbage Collection and started using the synthesize-by-default and no-declared-ivars features of the modern runtime.

Holy shit itâ€™s just too good. I <em>love</em> this. So much less code and less housekeeping. So nice. It makes it hard to go back this Monday morning to classic memory management and all the rest.
