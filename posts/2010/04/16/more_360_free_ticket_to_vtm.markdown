There’s more 360 iDev coverage on the <a href="http://www.taplynx.com/blog/general/360idev-action-suspense-sumo-take-downs">TapLynx weblog</a>. Extreme sumo take-downs included.

Also — you can win a free ticket to the Voices that Matter conference in Seattle just by doing a re-tweet: see <a href="http://twitter.com/taplynx">@taplynx on Twitter for details</a>. (Not the topmost tweet by now, but you’ll find it.) Seriously. Free ticket.
