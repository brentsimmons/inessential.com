I heard from our pals at Pearson that there’s still time to <a href="http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/iphone2010/">register for the Voices that Matter iPhone/iPad conference</a> in Seattle.

Look — Seattle rocks. It’s going to be so much fun. Fraser Speirs is coming all the way from Scotland. Wolf is speaking. Aaron Hillegass is speaking. Kevin Avila. Plenty more coolness.

And everybody I’ve talked to wants to <a href="http://www.shortydog.com/">go play pinball</a>.

Oh yeah, it’s <i>on</i>.

PS The title of this post is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Beach_(1959_film)">On the Beach</a> reference. By no means do I mean it is, or should be, men-only. It’s meant to impart a sense of urgency — like, register now to avert nuclear war. See? It’s hyperbole, which everybody enjoys all the time on the web.
