I had a great time at the <a href="http://www.360idev.com/">360 iDev iPhone/iPad conference</a> earlier this week. My thanks to John, Nicole, and Tom — and to all the speakers and sponsors and attendees. It was easily the best one yet.

I don’t think the next one has been announced — but pay attention for it. Totally worth going.

Some random notes from the last few days:

- <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/13/iphone-app-developers-consolidate-double-encore-buys-up-massively-overrated/">Double Encore acquired Massively Overrated</a>. A great fit. Very cool news. Congrats to all!

- <a href="http://www.zenirestaurant.com/">Zeni Restaurant</a> is very, very yummy. Ethiopian food.

- <a href="http://www.trialspub.com/">Trials</a> is a good bar — except that last call is at 11:30. 11:30? My attorney advises me that that contravenes the Geneva Convention. We’re investigating our options under international law.

- <a href="http://fastmac.com/">Fastmac</a> has an impact-resistant iPad case coming out. (Maybe it’s out? Not sure.) They did a demo by putting M&M’s in there and smashing it with a hammer. Didn’t hurt the candy. Magic case for magic device.

- Beards may be the key to winning at sumo wrestling. (Also, bare feet instead of socks, for better traction.) (And: sumo wrestling is high-larry-us.)

- Collin Donnell is the world’s sexiest programmer. I know this because his <a href="http://twitter.com/collindonnell">Twitter bio says so</a>. He hasn’t figured out if I’m teasing him — or flirting with him. So, yes, the poor fella has several months of deeply unsettling dreams to look forward to. (<a href="http://collindonnell.com/post/519713427/this-is-what-happens-at-360idev">He’s a rocket man</a>, by the way.)

- I put up my Keynote <a href="http://ranchero.com/downloads/BrentSimmons-ContentApps-360iDev.key.zip">slides on under-the-hood stuff for content apps</a>.

- I’m totally looking forward to <a href="http://twitter.com/ranajune">Rana June Sobhany</a>’s book.

- At some point a video of me singing Under the Bridge (playing Rock Band) may appear — which will be proof absolute that I shouldn’t be allowed near microphones. Or cameras. Especially not video cameras. (In my defense, I’d had enough beers to be awful, but not enough to be good.)

- <a href="http://faisal.com/">Faisal Jawdat</a> turned me on to <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/catpaint/id339462921?mt=8">Cat Paint</a>, which may be the greatest iPhone app ever.

- <a href="http://www.halfapixelshort.com/">Brad Ellis</a> (who designed <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/postage-postcards/id312231322?mt=8">Postage</a>, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snoglobe/id344579002?mt=8">SnoGlobe</a>, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/netnewswire-for-ipad/id363704172?mt=8">NetNewsWire/iPad</a>, etc.), has insane alien hands. Maybe that’s normal for designers, being from outer space?<br /><img src="http://inessential.com/images/bradtalks.png" alt="Brad talking" width="474" height="220" />
