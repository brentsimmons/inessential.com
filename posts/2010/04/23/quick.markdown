Fings...

- Check out Daniel Jalkut’s <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/1225/elements-of-twitter-style">Twitter style guide</a>. Good stuff.

- I posted my <a href="http://ranchero.com/downloads/iPadUIVolcanoBackupPlanTalk.key.zip">Keynote slides from last night’s Xcoders talk</a> with <a href="http://www.halfapixelshort.com/">Brad Ellis</a>. The topic was iPad UI — we talked about the design of NetNewsWire for iPad and looked at some other apps. The slides are mostly screen shots (and a few movies).

- Also from Brad Ellis: check out the <a href="http://inessential.com/images/nnwiPadLayers.png">screenshot of the layers</a> for his NetNewsWire/iPad project. It’s huge.

- I’m honored to be on the <a href="http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.26/26.03/MacTech25-3/index.html">MacTech 25 list</a>. Congratulations to all.
