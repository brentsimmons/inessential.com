I’ve been getting questions about the unofficial side of things around the Voices that Matter conference. What’s going on at night?

Some answers:

<strong>Thursday April 22</strong>

<a href="http://seattlexcoders.org/2010/04/20/april-22-meeting---brent-simmons-and-brad-ellis.html">Xcoders</a> meeting followed by <a href="http://www.cyclopsseattle.com/">Cyclops</a> for geek talk and food and/or drinks. <a href="http://twitter.com/bradellis">Brad Ellis</a> and I are doing an iPad UI Interactive Volcano Backup Plan Talk. Talking about NetNewsWire/iPad design plus other apps. (<a href="http://twitter.com/fraserspeirs">Fraser Speirs</a> is volcano-locked, so we’re filling in as best we can. Wish Fraser could have made it.)

If you’ve never been to an Xcoders meeting — or you’re from out of town but are arriving in Seattle early — you’re totally encouraged to attend. There’s no official sign-up or anything like that: just show up.

<strong>Friday April 23</strong>

<a href="http://www.mamas.com/lavalounge.htm">Lava Lounge</a> starting at 7 pm. It’s entirely possible we could go MPU (Mobile Party Unit) after a couple hours — see the note about Twitter, below.

<strong>Saturday April 24</strong>

<a href="http://www.shortydog.com/">Shorty’s</a> starting around 9 pm for pinball. (There’s a <a href="http://twitter.com/VTM_iphone/status/12533731827">sponsored thing</a> earlier for conference-goers.)

<strong>Bonus points</strong>

For late-breaking changes of venue or whatever, <a href="http://twitter.com/brentsimmons">follow me on Twitter</a>. I will not be offended if you follow me for the weekend and then unfollow.

All locations (except for Xcoders meeting) are in Belltown, which is convenient for conference-goers. (Xcoders meeting is downtown. Not much farther.)
