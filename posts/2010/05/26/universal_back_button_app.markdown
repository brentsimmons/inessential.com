<a href="http://www.scsc.no/blog/2010/05-26-universal-back-button-released-for-mac-os-x.html">Daniel Stødle</a>: “The idea is to provide a back button that takes you back to the task you were working on, before you opened a file, clicked a link, or similar.”

Clever and interesting. I bet I never would have thought to use the Apple events debug option to make this work. Cool.
