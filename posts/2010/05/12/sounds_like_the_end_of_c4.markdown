<a href="http://rentzsch.tumblr.com/post/592949476/c4-release">Wolf</a>: “Software engineering is advancing, albeit at a glacial pace. I spend most of my days writing in languages and using tools that were obsolete over a decade ago.”

Wolf talks about the lack of outcry over section 3.3.1. I’ve not cried out. I’ve been apathetic about it.

Well, maybe not totally apathetic — mostly I was glad because <em>I don’t like Flash</em>. I don’t like Flash because I’ve wasted too much time over the years dealing with Flash crashes.

But mainly I’ve been apathetic. Even though 3.3.1 isn’t all about Flash.

I don’t have time to care about everything. Should I make the time for this? I just don’t know. I don’t expect it will ever affect me personally, so it makes it that much tougher to care about. That’s not a laudable position, but it’s accurate (for me).

But there’s one notable thing here: there is no App Store for Macs, and no section 3.3.1 for Macs. C4 began as a Mac conference, and it could remain a Mac conference. I’ve been to every single one, and I’d love to go again. They’re been <em>hugely</em> valuable to me.

Regardless, Wolf deserves another huge round of applause and the heartfelt thanks of many people for putting on C4. It was always awesome.

I’m standing, saluting, and trying not to cry.
