The NetNewsWire team continues its amazing run — [we just released build 31](https://nnw.ranchero.com/2020/01/27/netnewswire-for-ios.html).

When we released build 30 two days ago, we were down to seven bugs.

In the last two days, the team fixed nine bugs.

How many bugs are left? Could it be -2? Nope: it’s 12.

7 - 9 = 12. That’s app-writin’ for ya.
