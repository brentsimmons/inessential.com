The Fair Isle Brewing company’s [tasting room opens today](https://www.myballard.com/2020/01/23/fair-isle-brewing-opens-today/)! (One of the partners is a friend: the one in the photo with the big gray beard.)

I had a preview a couple weeks ago. The beers are really, really good. 🎩🐥

The beers were…

> …created with ingredients farmed and foraged in the Pacific Northwest and fermented with our house blend of wild and feral yeasts and bacterias.

The name “Fair Isle” sounds like “feral.”
