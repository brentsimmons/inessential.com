The WordPress app for iOS is a free and open source app that doesn’t sell anything — but Apple, reportedly, [made the publisher change it so that it sells custom domain names](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/21/21396316/apple-wordpress-in-app-purchase-tax-update-store) via IAP, with the standard 30% cut going to Apple.

So now (or soon) the app *will* sell things.

Here’s where the worry turns personal for me…

NetNewsWire for iOS is a free and open source app that doesn’t sell anything, but it *does* let you use your Feedbin or Feedly account for syncing.

Will I be asked to add IAP to NetNewsWire for purchasing Feedbin and Feedly accounts? It doesn’t sound like that much of a stretch right now.

That’s not exactly what’s happening with the WordPress app, but it’s pretty close, and barriers just seem to get crossed these days.

Somebody on Twitter will tell me that I *should* add that IAP right now so I can pay Apple for the privilege of being on the App Store. Fuck you in advance.

Related question: how is the PR hit to Apple worth it for the money they’ll make through these WordPress IAP sales? And: how is developer fear a good thing for the platform?
