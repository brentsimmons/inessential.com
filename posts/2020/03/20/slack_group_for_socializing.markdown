I’ve seen a few people on Twitter asking if there’s a Slack group they could join for the purpose of socializing.

So I’ve set up a #socializing channel on the [NetNewsWire Slack group](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/slack). You’re welcome to join — you don’t have to be a NetNewsWire user.

Everybody on the Slack group is super-nice, and there is a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-of-conduct).

I’m not going to try to convince you to use NetNewsWire. 🐯 I’m just using the tool I have to help in this very small way.
