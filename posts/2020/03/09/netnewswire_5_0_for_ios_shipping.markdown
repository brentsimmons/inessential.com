Go get it [on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/netnewswire-rss-reader/id1480640210)! Also see the [announcement on the NetNewsWire blog](https://nnw.ranchero.com/2020/03/09/netnewswire-for-ios.html) and see the [NetNewsWire home page](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) for details.

It’s free and open source. Even though it’s labeled as 5.0, it’s a brand-new app, a fresh start for an app that originally appeared on the App Store on day one.

The big difference is not the price tag — there have been free versions of NetNewsWire before — and it’s not just that it’s open source. It’s that there’s a great team of volunteers behind it now.

Many are coders, for sure — and one of them, [Maurice Parker](https://vincode.io/), is the lead developer for the iOS version. We also have [Kiel Gillard](https://twitter.com/kielgillard) on Feedly syncing, [Nate Weaver](https://github.com/wevah) on under-the-hood goodness and CSS magic, and [many more](https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire/graphs/contributors).

There are also designers, writers, and testers. [Brad Ellis](https://twitter.com/bradellis) made the app icon, which I love. [Ryan Dotson](https://twitter.com/nostodnayr) wrote the excellent [help book](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/help/ios/5.0/en/).

Our friends at [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) generously run the web service that provides the Reader view, and they’ve helped with a number of technical issues.

And, at this writing, we have 8,211 people testing via TestFlight — and they’ve been great reporting crashes and bugs, making feature requests, and providing all kinds of feedback. Having that kind of huge community support has meant *everything* to the quality of the app. This release is dedicated to them.

I love saying that NetNewsWire is a team. Yes, sure, I wrote the bones and I manage the project and I put my name on it — but this team and what they’ve accomplished makes me so very, very proud and happy. 🎸🐯💥
