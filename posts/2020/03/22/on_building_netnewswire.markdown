On the NetNewsWire blog, I wrote about how it’s [easier to build NetNewsWire now](https://nnw.ranchero.com/2020/03/22/building-netnewswire-with.html) — and you don’t even need a paid developer account (just a free one).

Also: we welcome contributors! Of all skills levels and experience. *Especially* people new to app development. (NetNewsWire is my vehicle for giving back to the community, and one of the best to do that is to help new people get settled into the app development world.)
