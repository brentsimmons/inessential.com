Releasing an app always comes with surprises. No matter how many beta testers you have, there‚Äôs nothing like an app actually going out to the public.

We‚Äôve had, for [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) for iOS, a startling number of requests for the ability to choose from a list of alternate app icons.

This is a thing that some people really like these days. Even if it‚Äôs the exact same icon just with different color treatments. (A dark icon seems to be most commonly wished-for.)

This was *not* a thing the last time I released an iOS app. ([Vesper](https://github.com/brentsimmons/Vesper), back in 2013.) My guess is that, in the intervening years, we got API for this, and some developers have done this because, well, it‚Äôs fun. üçï

And now it‚Äôs a thing people expect.

Given that including additional app icons can‚Äôt slow down the app, why not just do it? What could possibly be the downsides?

#### Here Are All the Downsides

The first one is kind of obvious. It‚Äôs easy to think that this is something you could do in a couple hours. But remember that it‚Äôs not just a case of loading the app icon up in Photoshop and doing some quick versions with different colors.

The colors have to be chosen and tested. Each version has to be created in all the various different sizes. It‚Äôs quite a bit of work!

And our app icon maker [Brad Ellis](https://twitter.com/bradellis) is a father. Like everyone else on the team, he‚Äôs donating his time. Do I ask him to spend a few nights on this?

A second downside is that this takes time away from fixing bugs and doing things like bringing Feedly syncing to the Mac. (This feature requires layout, code, and testing ‚Äî it‚Äôs not just Photoshop work.)

The third downside is that each option we add takes NetNewsWire one step further away from the *simple* RSS reader that people love. We will have to add options in the future ‚Äî¬†but, knowing that, we need to be super-careful about what we add so it doesn‚Äôt balloon. (You probably don‚Äôt remember NetNewsWire 3.3.2‚Äôs preferences window. It was *extensive*.)

The fourth downside is related to the third, and might be the most important. My previous decade of experience with NetNewsWire tells me that there is a sizable set of users who get kind of stuck on things like this. The more customization there is, the more time they spend on it. Any time we add something like this, we‚Äôre adding to their anxiety.

To be clear: I‚Äôm not disdainful of these people, not in the least tiny bit. I recognize it in myself, even. I want the ability to make things just-so, and it never, ever is, quite, but I keep trying. And maybe I ask the developer to add just one more option, but with this particular shade of blue or orange ‚Äî¬†and they do, but it‚Äôs still not quite right, so I go back to tweaking some more, maybe going another route‚Ä¶ and‚Ä¶

This just isn‚Äôt good.

#### What We‚Äôre Doing

These are still very early days for the app ‚Äî and so we‚Äôre going with a couple simple policies.

<b>Add options when needed for accessibility.</b> We support Dark Mode, for instance, which is for many people an accessibility issue. (We use Apple‚Äôs colors for this, on the grounds that they‚Äôve done more research and design for this than we ever could.)

<b>Add options that reduce anxiety.</b> An example of this is the option to not show the unread count in the Dock on Macs. (There‚Äôs a similar setting in Notifications settings in iOS.)

Alternate app icons won‚Äôt help with accessibility, and they certainly won‚Äôt help with anxiety.

That‚Äôs not to say we wouldn‚Äôt ever do this. Or we might just add a dark version. But not right now.

I know this will disappoint some people. My pledge is that, even when I‚Äôm disappointing you, I will tell you honestly why.

(We‚Äôll probably do themes for the article view way before we would do something like this, because 1) that‚Äôs fun too!, and 2) it‚Äôs an accessibility/readability issue.)
