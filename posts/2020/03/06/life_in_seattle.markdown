We’re avoiding other humans.

I’m home and Sheila’s home. Omni asked, earlier this week, that employees not come into the office unless necessary for a task, and I don’t miss jamming myself into the overcrowded and sneezy bus route 40 three days a week.

We’ve stocked-up on food and supplies, at least for a while. I do leave the house to go running, but I figure that’s safe.

[Xcoders and NSCoder Night](https://xcoders.org/2020/03/05/canceled-next-xcoders.html) have been canceled. [The Quilt Show](https://www.quiltersanonymous.org/index.php/Quilt-Show.html) has been canceled.

I don’t really know what the rest of the city feels like right now, since I’m just home or running around my neighborhood.

Trees and flowers are starting to bloom, so I have the sniffles, like every year in March. Birds are chirping and scrambling outside my office window.

This could be my life for a while. Your life might look something like this pretty soon. Hopefully not.

I miss going to restaurants.

We have a family member in Seattle, who we see twice a month, usually, who’s in the vulnerable class, and I don’t know when we’ll see him next.

A black rooster just walked through my backyard, which is a first. The sun comes and goes during the day.
