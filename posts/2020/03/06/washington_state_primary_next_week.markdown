I’m very curious to see what happens in the Washington State primary next week.

In 2016, [Sanders won the caucuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Washington_Democratic_caucuses) overwhelmingly. I caucused, and I can say that the state results were pretty close to the results in my particular caucus.

Weirdly, we _also_ held a primary that didn’t count. In that vote, Clinton won narrowly. That was about two months after the caucus.

This year we’re back to a primary vote, with no caucus. All our voting is by mail, and many people cast their votes while Warren, Klobuchar, Bloomberg, and Buttigieg were still in the race and before Biden’s wins in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday.

I’m confident that my neighborhood will vote for Sanders. You could easily argue that Sanders is likely to win the state, given his landslide victory last time.

But this is also a different year, and caucuses tended to favor Sanders, and we’re running a primary.

But, then, lots of people voted early, so… and now there’s this virus.

I have no idea what’s going to happen, but I’m super-curious.

PS For me personally, the remaining candidates in the race are something like my sixth and seventh choices. That’s how it goes sometimes. The people I really wanted are out. But I will of course vote in the general election for the Democrat — always have, always will.
