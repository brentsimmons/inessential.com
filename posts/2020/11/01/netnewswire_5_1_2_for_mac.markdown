We’ve released [NetNewsWire 5.1.2 for Mac](https://nnw.ranchero.com/2020/11/01/netnewswire-for-mac.html) and submitted NetNewsWire 5.0.5 for iOS to App Store review.

Both fix some bugs, including crashing bugs, and increase performance.

We plan for these to be the final 5.x builds — next up will be test builds of NetNewsWire 6, which will support more syncing systems, including iCloud. The team is psyched!
