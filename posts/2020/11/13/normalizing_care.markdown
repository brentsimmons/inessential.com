When cases rise, they rise. The risk now is higher than ever.

Some things I think about…

Even going for a ride in the car is a risk. A friend got in a car accident (fault: other driver) and was taken to the ER in an ambulance, where my friend could have been exposed to the virus.

Let’s say I go for a ride and my car breaks down. I’d have the AAA person coming and a trip to a service station in my future. Is that all safe?

Another friend is currently in quarantine after a trip to the dentist resulted in contact with a person who subsequently tested positive.

I keep thinking: something we’ve done a dozen times isn’t necessarily safe. It’s just that the odds haven’t caught up yet. Next time could be the time.

Something that *feels* safe isn’t necessarily safe. Our feelings are the opposite of helpful — they’re convincing us of things that aren’t true.

I’ve twice had the vital duty of being in the hospital room when a family member dies. What if I couldn’t have been? What if no family could be there? I can barely think about this without tearing up. What if it were me in the hospital, and my family couldn’t be there — what would that do to them?

What if a family member has a heart attack and can’t even get a bed in the ICU?

What if I give the virus to a family member and they die?

Anyway: *please* be careful. I know there’s pressure not to. But thousands of people alive and healthy today will be dead by New Year’s. Being careful saves lives.
