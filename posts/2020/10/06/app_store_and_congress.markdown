For a few months I’ve been trying to avoid the App Store as a topic.

I have — we all have — enough to be upset about these days, and I just don’t need this as another thing that’s eating me up. So I decided, once bigger and louder players got involved, that I could leave it to them and try to ignore the topic. Not let it get to me.

And now there’s a [report from a House Judiciary subcommittee](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/10/06/house-judiciary-committee-report) on this topic. The report quotes this blog twice (on pages 341 and 350) — and I am very proud.

It means I can stop banging my head against this particular wall — *Congress* is looking at it. I stand by ready to help, but I think it’s well beyond me now, and I can otherwise let this go. For the sake of my own health.
