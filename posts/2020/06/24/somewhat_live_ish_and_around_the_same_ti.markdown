You’ll recall that James Dempsey does a benefit concert every year: Live Near WWDC.

Well, this year it’s not exactly live. [But it’s still happening](https://jamesdempsey.net/live2020)!

You may see me in the video. Wearing a Panama hat and dark shirt. Playing guitar and/or keyboards. But watch it anyway. 🐥🎸
