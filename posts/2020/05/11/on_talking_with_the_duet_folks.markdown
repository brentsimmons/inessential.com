One of the teams I talked to during my job hunt — and that didn’t put me through a scary tech interview :) — was the [folks at Duet](https://www.duetdisplay.com/).

They make an app where you can use an iPad as a second screen for your Mac. They also support Android and Windows. (You should check out their apps.)

I thoroughly enjoyed talking with the team, and I believe I would have been very happy working there.

They’re looking for a Mac developer. Maybe you? Get in touch via [their contact page](https://www.duetdisplay.com/contact).
