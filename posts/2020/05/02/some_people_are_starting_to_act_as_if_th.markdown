Some people are starting to act as if this whole thing is pretty much over. It has become more and more the norm to bend the rules, and there will be increased social pressure to go along.

I think this is important to note: you will feel bad, sometimes really bad, if you donâ€™t go along.

But please remember that this is a *sacrifice*. Part of that sacrifice might be that you have to feel bad about not doing what your group is doing. But we have to do this to save lives.
