While I’ve been job-hunting, the mighty NetNewsWire team has kept rolling — and today we published the first update to the iOS app.

This update fixes bugs, makes the app faster, and adds polish. Read the (rather lengthy) [change notes](https://nnw.ranchero.com/2020/05/12/netnewswire-for-ios.html) for the full scoop.

We did add one new feature: on the settings screen you can choose which color palette to use: go with the current system setting or specify light or dark.

If you’re already running NetNewsWire, it should update in the normal way. If you haven’t tried it yet, go get it — for free — [on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/netnewswire-rss-reader/id1480640210).
