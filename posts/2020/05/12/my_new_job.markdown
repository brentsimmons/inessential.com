As of this morning the ink is all dry, and I can happily report that my new job is at [Audible](https://www.audible.com/). I’ll be an architect on the mobile team.

I’m very excited for this job! It’s perfect for me in so many ways — not least that it’s about *books*.

My plan is for this to be my last job — I plan to work at Audible until I retire. I start Monday. 🐣🐥🕶
