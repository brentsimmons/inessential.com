I went outside yesterday to bring my emptied garbage and yard waste cans back from the street.

It was a pretty nice day — not really sunny but warm enough. Lots of people were outside. The woman on the corner was talking to somebody on the sidewalk. My neighbors were out. There was a bicyclist on the street, some folks walking on my side of the street, some folks walking on the other side of the street. The guy who lives behind me was outside and playing music.

*Way* too many people. It felt oppressive. I beelined it back inside after taking off my gloves.
