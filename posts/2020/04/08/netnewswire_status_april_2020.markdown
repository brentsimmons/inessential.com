It was only few months ago I wrote up a [NetNewsWire 2020 roadmap](https://inessential.com/2019/12/26/netnewswire_2020_roadmap_schmoadmap) — and that roadmap is *already* wrong!

Not a surprise. That’s apps for ya.

But also: remember that NetNewsWire is made by a group of volunteers, and we all live in the same world everybody else lives in. I even [lost my job](https://inessential.com/2020/03/31/looking_for_work), and I’m spending much of my time looking for a new job. (Had I not been laid-off, NetNewsWire 5.0.1 for iOS would probably have shipped already.)

Here’s what — we think — is coming up next. Probably in this order, even!

#### NetNewsWire 5.0.1 for iOS

This release will include a bunch of bug fixes and improvements. We’re down to the last few bugs right now. I expect this to be on the App Store within a few weeks.

#### NetNewsWire 5.0.4 for Mac

This release is also a bug-fixes-and-improvements release. No new features.

#### NetNewsWire 5.1 for Mac

This release will add Feedly syncing, a Reader view, and other features that the iOS version already has. It might be sandboxed and might also be on the MAS. (Not totally sure yet.) Should include support for at least one other sync system.

#### NetNewsWire 5.1 for iOS

Support for additional sync systems. Other things. (Hard to say at this distance.)

When will anything actually ship? There are [No ETAs](https://inessential.com/2019/10/28/no_etas). And everything in the above schedule could change!
