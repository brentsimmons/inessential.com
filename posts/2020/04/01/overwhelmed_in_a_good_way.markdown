I have never in my life had as many people getting in touch with me than over the past 24 hours. (I’m *way* behind on answering email and Twitter DMs.)

Many are messages of support, which I cherish and thank you for.

There are also people asking if I might be interested in working with them — which is awesome. I have an open mind, and all kinds of different work sound interesting to me.

I do have three requirements:

* I’m going to stay in Seattle
* I’m going to continue to work on NetNewsWire
* I’m going to continue blogging here

I could work in an office again (once that kind of thing is possible again). Or not. I could do coding. Or writing. Or marketing or managing or designing. I could work on iOS or Mac apps. I could do something cloud-related. Good work is interesting, and I’m not stuck on any one particular type of work.

But the things that make me *me* won’t change. I’m a Seattle guy who blogs and writes an open source RSS reader.

Have I said how lucky I am? I am amazingly lucky and fortunate. There are plenty of people to worry about during the current crisis. I’m not one of those people.
