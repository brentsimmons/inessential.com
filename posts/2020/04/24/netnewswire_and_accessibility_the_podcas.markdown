Maurice Parker, NetNewsWire iOS lead developer, talks about accessibility in the [latest episode of the AppleVis podcast](https://www.applevis.com/podcast/applevis-extra-71-depth-interview-maurice-parker-netnewswire).

I love this for a couple reasons: itâ€™s about accessibility, which is a core value; and a member of the NetNewsWire team who isnâ€™t me did the interview. It was Mauriceâ€™s first podcast interview, and he did a fantastic job. ðŸŽ¸
