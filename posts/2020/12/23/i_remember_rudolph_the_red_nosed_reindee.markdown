I remember [Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058536/) as my favorite of the Christmas specials — as the truly great of the genre, as the Superman of Christmas specials.

And then we watched it last night, for probably the first time this century. It was *brutal*.

The story was pretty rough to start with: mutant child laborer is shunned until the CEO finds a way to exploit his difference, and only then do his peers accept him. And we’re supposed to take that as a happy ending.

But there’s something far, far worse that I had utterly forgotten.

Here’s the scene: the Abominable Snow Monster is threatening Rudolph’s family. Yukon Cornelius causes a boulder to fall on the monster’s head and he passes out. And then — here’s where Sheila and I both gasped — Hermey, the elf who, charmingly, wants to be a dentist, *pulls out all of the snow monster’s teeth*. The teeth are shown, pulled out by the roots, littered on the snow.

Hermey is a fucking war criminal. We’re shook.
