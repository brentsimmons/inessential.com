I was a guest on the Supertop podcast a couple weeks ago, and I spaced on linking to it.

<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/supertop-podcast/id1143273587?mt=2">Here’s the podcast</a>. It’s made by the fine folks who make Unread and Castro. (I’m an Unread user. It’s in my iPhone’s dock, even.)

(I’d check out Castro except that I actually don’t listen to podcasts on my iPhone. I listen to them at work via my iTunes on my Mac. Which is dreadfully weird of me, I know.)
