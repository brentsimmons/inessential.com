<a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/143083/making-vesper-netnewswire-omnifocus-top-dev-interview-brent-simmons">Adam Rush interviewed me</a> for raywenderlich.com.

Adam asks me about public speaking, and I reply that I have the goal of “making it seem like nothing, as if I just got up and started talking to you” — which is more of a peek into my head than it sounds like.

I remind myself to <em>make it seem like nothing</em> many times per day. Not just with public speaking but especially with writing words and apps.

I think I mean a few different things by that. Don’t be show-offy. Don’t be self-conscious. Don’t do fancy or clever things just because I can. Make it look easy and effortless.

I don’t claim that I succeed at all this — just that that’s my aesthetic mantra.
