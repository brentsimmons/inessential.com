Orange leader. Dominance and narcissism and corruption and bullshit and lies. Families breaking up. The claim of making the world great masking a business empire.

See <a href="http://www.aetv.com/shows/leah-remini-scientology-and-the-aftermath">Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath</a>. It’s riveting.

And I can’t help but feel like, in a way, all of America just joined Scientology. (Not literally, of course.)

<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Man-High-Castle-Philip-Dick/dp/0547572484/">The Man in the High Castle</a> has long been my favorite Philip K. Dick novel, and one of my favorite novels ever.

(My Mom pushed it on me when I was a teenager. I’ve been a Dickhead ever since.)

In it, the Germans and Japanese won the second World War (or did they?) and America is split up and occupied — by the Japanese empire on the west and the Reich to the east.

I’m five episodes into the <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/The-New-World/dp/B00RSGIVVO/ref=sr_1_1?s=instant-video&ie=UTF8&qid=1483039150&sr=1-1&keywords=the+man+in+the+high+castle">TV show</a>. It doesn’t faithfully track the novel — it’s much more of a thriller than I remember from the book. Which is fine: the novel is a novel, and the TV show is a TV show.

And I can hardly pull myself away, not least because it also speaks to the current moment.
