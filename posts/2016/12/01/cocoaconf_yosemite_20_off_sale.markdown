This March will be my third trip in three years to Yosemite — I can’t miss it. I’m hopelessly addicted to one of the most beautiful places in the world.

You can go too! It’s <a href="http://cocoaconf.com/blog/week-of-mondays">20% off if you register this week</a>.

It’s not a code conference — it’s about people and art and love. Sessions are in the morning and evening, so you can go on hikes during the day.

It’s so much more beautiful and awe-inspiring in real life than on your desktop.
