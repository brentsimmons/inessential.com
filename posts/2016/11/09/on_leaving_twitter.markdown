I can’t *really* leave Twitter, because I don’t want someone else to take my username. But I did make my account private and I unfollowed everybody. If you @-mention me, I’ll never know.

Twitter was always a 51-49 thing for me — barely worth it. The company has not dealt with harassment. It has treated its third-party developers shabbily. And, at best, it was just quips and outrages — a diet of candy.

And then it was part of the system that helped elect a fascist President. This tipped it over for me: it’s no longer worth my participation. The shitheads can have it.

<i>Update 2:30 pm</i>: If you want to reach me, you can. My email address is my Twitter username plus the domain for Apple’s email service.
