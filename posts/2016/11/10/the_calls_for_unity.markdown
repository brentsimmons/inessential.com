I don’t have a Facebook account, because Facebook is bad for humanity — but I’ve heard from people who do have an account that there are people, regular people, who supported Trump and who are now asking for unity, who ask that we come together as a country.

Which cracks me up, because they just voted for disunity. It was on the ballot, and they said yes, give me that. Maybe they voted against free trade or whatever, but the <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2016/11/10/the-cinemax-theory-of-racism/">package included disunity</a>, quite clearly and boldly.

Just so there’s no mistaking: fuck those people. They wanted disunity, and they got it.
