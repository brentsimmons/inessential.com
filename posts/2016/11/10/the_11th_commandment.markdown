People who don’t look like you have the exact same experience of consciousness you have. They have the same capacity for intelligence and grace that you have. They feel pain and injustice — and joy and love — in the same way you do.

David Owens <a href="https://owensd.io/2016/11/10/a-christian-in-america-a-personal-story/">reminds us of Jesus’s words</a>:

>A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.

I thought all my life that that was Christianity distilled. I still think it is.

But there’s a difference between the power of Christianity — to redeem, to give hope, to open hearts — and the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/the-evangelical-reckoning-on-trump/507161/">Christianity of power</a>. The Christianity of power isn’t Christianity at all.
