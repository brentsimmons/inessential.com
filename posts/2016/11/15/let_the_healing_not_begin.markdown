I was struck by a quote in a <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/education/seattle-area-students-walking-out-of-class-to-protest-election-of-trump/">Seattle Times article yesterday</a> about an impending walk-out by high school students protesting Trump.

Highline school Superintendent Susan Enfield, who is probably a very good person, wrote, in a letter to families:

>Although the election itself is behind us, we are now at the beginning of a long journey toward healing and uniting as a people. That healing process must start in each one of us.

Nope.

Look — the bad things have barely begun to happen. As bad as the election was, it’s not the bad thing. The bad things are still to come. Healing will be needed, yes, but the bad things are going to happen first.

<a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/mcconnell-quotes-obama-senate-floor">Another quote</a>, from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell:

>We’re all rooting for the President-elect’s success in uniting and leading the country.

The President-elect ran on a platform of us against them. So fuck that.
