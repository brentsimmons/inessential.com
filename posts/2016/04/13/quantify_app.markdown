The folks making “App: the Human Story” have just released their <em>own</em> app: <a href="http://quantifyapp.io/">Quantify</a>.

The idea is that while you’re shooting video — an interview or whatever — you can rate the action as it goes along, and then you have that when you go to edit. Saves a ton of time.

If I made videos, I’d get this app.

PS The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/appdocu/app-the-human-story/posts/1534824">latest update on the documentary</a>:

>We’re pushing hard and plan on showing you the film the first part of June, right before WWDC.

Good timing.
