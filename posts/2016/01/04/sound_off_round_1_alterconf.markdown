From Sound Off:

>AlterConf is a traveling conference series that provides safe opportunities for marginalized people and those who support them in the tech and gaming industries. By highlighting the powerful voices and positive initiatives of local community members, we build hope and strengthen the community’s resolve to create safer, healthier spaces for everyone.

>The conferences go beyond the limited definitions and basic discussions of diversity to create a deeper, more nuanced conversation. Each conference features a wide range of speakers delivering critical analyses of tech and gaming culture and presenting their vision for what our community can be.

>To ensure that every event is accessible to as many people as possible, AlterConf provides both live captioning and American Sign Language interpreters, which cost an average of $1500 to $2000 per conference. You can help AlterConf continue to provide these essential affordances at future events by donating at: <a href="http://soundofftech.org/alterconf">http://soundofftech.org/alterconf</a>

Sound Off is a new foundation with the <a href="http://soundofftech.org">mission</a> of increasing “access to professional settings for marginalized peoples in tech.”

It’s an important goal.

Once a month Sound Off will do a donation drive for a specific thing (such as live-captioning and ASL for AlterConf), and I’ll post here to help publicize it.

People of the future will look back and judge us for how well or poorly we expanded our tribe.
