On the Omni blog, <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/looking-back-looking-ahead-2016-edition">Ken Case writes</a> about how we did in 2015 and what’s coming up in 2016.

My personal favorite part:

>For OmniOutliner, I’m very pleased to share that we have some major writing improvements on the way! On both Mac and iOS, we plan to support distraction-free full-screen editing, the ability to see your current word count, and support for directly editing <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> documents.

Lately I’ve been working on <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner">OmniOutliner</a> for Mac. (It’s my favorite Omni app.) Helping to add Markdown support is going to be fun.
