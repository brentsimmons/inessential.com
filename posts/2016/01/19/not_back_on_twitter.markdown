When the new Star Wars movie came out, I decided to take a break from Twitter so I could avoid spoilers. I mostly kept away (but for a few small hits).

I finally saw the movie (which I enjoyed) this past weekend, and so I came back to Twitter.

Now, a few hours later, I’m off Twitter again. I didn’t like being back.

This past year was very bad — see <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/10/07/in_the_room">In the Room</a> — and 2016 will be bad for the same reason.

And I turn 48 in a couple months. And I have a whole lot of work I want to do and not necessarily enough time to do it all.

(Note: my personal health is good. I don’t want to give the wrong idea here.)

Here’s what I found: being off Twitter, that squeaky treadmill, gave me back some time, and it made me happier and calmer than I would have been.

(It’s hard to measure, because of everything going on, but I believe it, and that’s what matters.)

I know full well that I have a responsibility, as a writer and maker of things, to be accessible, and I take that seriously.

But I also have a responsibility to myself, and to people close to me, to be happy. I do everything better when I’m happy — including helping other people.

It’s a trade-off, but I have to care for my own happiness.

Which means I’m back to ignoring Twitter.

I’m not deleting my account, but I’ve turned off all notifications and uninstalled the app from all computers and devices. I just won’t be looking.

If you need to reach me: take my Twitter handle and assume that I use Apple’s email service. Old-fashioned, yes, but it works.

The happiest I’ve ever been in front of a computer was when I was 14 at my Apple II Plus, with headphones on, working on my little BASIC apps. No network and no distractions. Simple and quiet.

While I love the web, I don’t love those corners that insist on my attention. I don’t have to accept it. I just want to make things.
