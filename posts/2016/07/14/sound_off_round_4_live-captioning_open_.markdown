From <a href="https://www.youcaring.com/open-source-feelings-597220">Sound Off</a>:

>[Open Source & Feelings](http://www.osfeels.com/) has a thorough and unambiguous [code of conduct](http://www.osfeels.com/conduct), one of the best [diversity statements](http://www.osfeels.com/diversity/) we’ve seen from a conference, and an [about](http://www.osfeels.com/about/) page with everything from venue accessibility, to public transit, to tips about keeping safe while traveling to and from the conference. Everything about Open Source & Feelings communicates thoughtfulness, deliberateness, and listening to feedback.

Sound Off board member Ashley Nelson-Hornstein explains <a href="http://ashleynh.me/live-captioning/">how live-captioning is useful for all physically-present attendees</a>, not just for people you’d expect to need the help.

It’s also worth remembering that accessibility issues aren’t just something for a small percentage of the population.

Everybody has — or will have, if they live long enough — something they need help with. I have increasing trouble hearing, and live-captioning would certainly help *me*, and maybe you too.

Straight up: [help make sure everyone can participate](https://www.youcaring.com/open-source-feelings-597220).

PS The conference will be here in Seattle, at Seattle Central College. I was on the college newspaper there, in moons past.
