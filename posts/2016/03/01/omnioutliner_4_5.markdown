<a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner">OmniOutliner 4.5</a> is up on Omni’s site, and should be in the Mac App Store within days.

With this release — <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/releasenotes/omnioutliner-mac">see the release notes</a> — I helped work on, of all things, *printing* bugs and features. This is the first time in my entire career where I worked on printing support that was more than just the most basic possible thing.

And that sounds weird for the year 2016, I realize. But here’s the thing: working on printing support is far from glamorous. You wouldn’t call it *fun*. But the people who need these features really do need them, and it’s a matter of respect for OmniOutliner users that we do a great job even with printing.

But I sure am glad to get it finished and shipping. And I’m proud of the work we did — more proud than I expected to be. It’s solid, and I think the people who print from OmniOutliner will be very pleased.

Now we’re on to <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/looking-back-looking-ahead-2016-edition">other new features</a>, including editing Markdown documents with OmniOutliner.
