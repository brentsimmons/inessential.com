Write some good songs — that people like *and* that make them laugh — and make some slides to go with them. Create an album of those songs that appears in the iTunes charts. Then write some more songs.

Then — just to up the ante — do a bunch of live performances every year, but <em>never with the same band</em>. And be a great singer and entertainer every single time.

<em>And</em> be an intelligent, friendly, and good person. A person anybody would be glad to call friend.

That’s <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesdempsey">James Dempsey</a>.

Because the songs are nerdy and funny, because James looks like a guy who’s just having fun, it might be easy to overlook what an achievement all this is. *You* try it!

<p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>

I’ve played with James several times, which makes me a Conditional Breakpoint. (Including most recently at the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/cocoaconf/sets/72157663770400704">Yosemite Cocoaconf</a>.)

I’ve played campfire guitar and the occasional piano-found-in-a-bar — but never, before James, have I played with other musicians with a set list and a crowd. It’s such a pleasure, and one that I never expected in life. So much fun.

I have James to thank.

And I’d also like to thank, from the most recent Yosemite show: <a href="https://twitter.com/jdalrymple">Jim</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/savinola">Laura</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/apike">Allen</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/macgenie">Jean</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/settern">Serenity</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/griotspeak">TJ</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dimsumthinking">Daniel</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/cpickslay">Christopher</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/songadaymann">Jonathan</a>. That right there is a super-group.

PS I remember a few spots where I messed up. The ending of a couple songs, and coming out of the bridge on “Model View Controller.” I’ll nail those at <a href="http://cocoaconf.com/seattle-2016/home">Seattle CocoaConf</a>. :)

PPS In case you don’t already have it, <a href="http://jamesdempsey.org/backtrace/">you can get the album</a>.

PPPS With Jonathan there, how could we resist doing a live performance of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCXItGrjqrw">ATP theme song</a>? We couldn’t. I assume there will be a video at some point and I’ll link to it.

*Update 3:30 pm:* Here’s an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSZEXHnioT0&feature=youtu.be">iPhone video of the ATP theme song</a>, recorded by <a href="https://twitter.com/amilhamdev">Andrew Milham</a>. And more of a <a href="http://youtu.be/I57v1QxZgmI">close-up video</a> recorded by <a href="https://twitter.com/kimahlberg">Kim Ahlberg</a>.
