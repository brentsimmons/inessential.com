Sound Off is raising money for <a href="http://soundofftech.org/blog/2016/03/round-2-uikonf/">live captioning at UIKonf</a>:

>Live captioning for UIKonf is not only going to open up the conference to the deaf community and the hard of hearing, but will be indispensable for many of the attendees for whom English is not their first language.
