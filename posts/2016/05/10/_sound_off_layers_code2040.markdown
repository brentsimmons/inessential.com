Sound Off is raising money to send two fellows or alumni of CODE2040 to Layers 2016. You can <a href="https://www.youcaring.com/layers-code2040-564219">donate here</a> and help them reach their goal. (At the time of this writing they’re over halfway there.)

More info: Layers is a <a href="https://bringyourlayers.com">design conference</a> for the Mac and iOS community in San Francisco, taking place June 13-15. It’s “like a party, but for learning.”

And <a href="http://www.code2040.org">CODE2040</a> “creates access, awareness, and opportunities for top Black and Latino/a engineering talent to ensure their leadership in the innovation economy.”

Very cool things that deserve your help.
