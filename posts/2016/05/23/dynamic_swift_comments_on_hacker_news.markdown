I don’t generally point to (or even read) comments on Hacker News — because in the past I’ve found that they’re like other comments on the web.

However, I think the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11748010">Hacker News comments</a> on Michael Tsai’s <a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/2016/05/21/dynamic-swift-2/">Dynamic Swift</a> post are worth reading.
