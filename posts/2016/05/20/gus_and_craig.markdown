>Being able to write dynamic, responder chain-like code in Swift or Objective-C (or whatever) is extremely important to me. And if I had to give one reason why it would be this: Dynamic code is less code, and less code means fewer bugs and maintenance.

>The community around Swift’s evolution is amazing. The language is improving quickly and dramatically thanks to talented developers inside and outside of Apple. It’s a remarkable open source project.

>My concern is that there isn’t a corresponding discussion about the things we’re going to build with this new language. As you’ve just seen, frameworks are important, yet there is no uikit-evolution mailing list. There is an imbalance between the tool and the craft.
