In case you haven’t seen it mentioned already — <a href="https://bringyourlayers.com/">Layers</a> is a design conference in San Francisco taking place the same week as WWDC. It’s “like a party, but for learning,” and promises snacks, and people I respect tell me it’s wonderful.

Be sure to scroll down and look at the list of presenters. It’s amazing.
