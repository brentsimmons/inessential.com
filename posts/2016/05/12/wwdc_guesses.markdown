These are collected from a Seattle-area Slack team I’m on. In no particular order, without any judgments about likelihood:

* Side-loading of iOS apps.

* Trials and upgrade pricing on the iOS and Mac App Stores.

* carOS.

* The “plus” form factor is discontinued.

* Run iOS apps on Macs.

* Use UIKit to build Mac apps.

* There is no OS X and iOS 10, only TEN.

* iTunes is broken up into pieces, including a separate Apple Music streaming service app.

* ARM-based MacBooks.

* Third-party API for Siri.

* The revival of the handwriting recognition API.

* XPC services on iOS.

* Two-up display from a single app on iOS.

* Encouragement of MVVM-like architecture in UIKit and AppKit.

* Keyboard-driven UI selection on iPad.

* UIReact. (The person who suggested this is trying to get my goat, but I’m keeping my goat.)

* 5K Cinema Display.

* NEW MAC PRO.

* Drag-and-drop on iOS.

* Lots more leather straps for the watch.

* Apple Watch straps that add more functionality (GPS, cellular, etc.)

* Apple Pay peer-to-peer payments. (SquareCash-like-thing.)

* Apple Pay rewards cards.

* Cram the whole computer in the Watch, and everything (monitor, keyboard, touchscreen) are all just wireless peripherals.

* Major upgrade for HomeKit.

* Rosetta for X86-64 on ARM (along with those ARM-based machines).

* Siri-ous work on Siri.

* FAT BINARIES.

* Support for 32-bit apps to end on OS X.

* OS X names: Barstow, Yermo, Shasta, Weed, Compton, Disney, Death Valley, La Jolla, So’side Quay, Tahoe, Truckee, Needles, Donner, La Brea, Stockton, Joshua Tree (for the U2 marketing), San Andreas.

* s/OS X/macOS/g

* FREE SONG ON YOUR MAC.

* Siri on the Mac.

* iMeeting.

* Core Data improvements. (Goes with San Andreas fault. Probably a small joke.)
