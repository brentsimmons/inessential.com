Sound Off is <a href="https://www.youcaring.com/affect-conf-652638">raising money for childcare at Affect</a>, a new conference in Portland. The goal is to pay for two childcare providers by raising $2400.

Here’s the thing: everybody who wants to should be able to go to conferences. Everybody should be able to learn things, meet new people, and help other people.

Just because you have a child who needs care shouldn’t disqualify you. Simple as that.

<a href="https://affectconf.com/">Affect</a> is a “2-day event about the work, culture, and design of social change.”
