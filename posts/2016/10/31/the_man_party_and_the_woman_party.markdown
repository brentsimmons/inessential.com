This weekend I voted — proudly, enthusiastically, and happily — for Hillary Clinton. It’s my third vote for Hillary this year, because Washington state is weird and has both a caucus and a primary.

I was struck this election by just how many women I voted for — more women than men. In many races, the choice was between a Republican man and a Democratic woman. It looked almost as if our parties are actually the Man party and the Woman party. (Even in the non-partisan races you could tell the party affiliation of most candidates.)

I voted for <a href="http://www.pramilaforcongress.com">Pramila Jayapal</a> to represent Washington’s 7th Congressional District. She’ll replace the retiring Jim McDermott. I voted for <a href="http://www.murray.senate.gov/public/">Patty Murray</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/GaelTarleton">Gael Tarleton</a>, <a href="http://www.noelframe.com/">Noel Frame</a>, <a href="http://www.votersfortina.com/">Tina Podlodowski</a>, <a href="http://www.patmccarthy.org/">Pat McCarthy</a>, <a href="http://hilaryfranz.com/">Hilary Franz</a>, <a href="http://justicemaryyu.com/">Mary Yu</a>, and <a href="http://www.chiefjusticemadsen.org/">Barbara Madsen</a>. (I’m forgetting some of the races, surely — the actual list is longer.)

It feels, surprisingly, like a big relief. I’m a 48-year-old straight white male who’s done pretty well in life — which makes me part of the traditional ruling class, I suppose. It felt *amazingly* good to help make it so that people like me don’t have to be in charge of every damn thing. Why should we be? Why would we even *want* to?

PS How awesome is Mary Yu. She’s a judge with a name that sounds like “marry you” — and she opened her court at midnight to perform the first same-sex marriages in Washington State.
