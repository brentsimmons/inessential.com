<a href="http://speirs.org/2007/11/02/twitterrific-3/">Fraser Speirs</a> writes about Twitterrific 3.0, which now displays ads or costs $14.95 (you choose):</p>

<p><blockquote>Let’s face it—if you’re an indie Mac developer, Twitter is like a year round WWDC doughnut stand. It’s where I hang out with the other indies for the other fifty-one weeks of the year. If an easy interface to that world isn’t worth $15 to me, then I’ve got some messed up priorities.</blockquote></p>

<p>The list of people I follow on Twitter is a lot like a listing of my /Applications folder, and it’s also a list of people I hang out with at events like C4 and WWDC.</p>

<p>It may be especially cool for people like me who work at home—it’s my virtual office.</p>

<p>But, were it not for Twitterrific, I probably wouldn’t have even tried it at all.
