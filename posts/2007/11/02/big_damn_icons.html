<a href="http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/macosxhints/2007/11/big105icons/index.php?lsrc=mwrss">An article on Macworld</a> reminded me that Leopard can use really big icons for applications.</p>

<p>I remembered that I had a super-large version of the NetNewsWire app icon, and so I could easily add 512 and 256 representations. Well, easily, <em>maybe</em>—as long as the process itself is easy.</p>

<p>Turns out it was. I just launched /Developer/Applications/Utilities/Icon Composer.app, did a couple drag-and-drops from the Finder, and I was finished. So the next beta will include 512 and 256 versions of the icon.</p>

<p>Here’s a <a href="http://inessential.com/images/nnw_coverflow.png">screenshot of the big icon</a> in the Finder’s cover-flow view.
