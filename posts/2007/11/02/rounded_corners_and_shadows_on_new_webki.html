I wasn’t planning on redesigning my weblog—but then I was recently reminded that you can do shadows and rounded corners using new CSS bits in the latest WebKit.</p>

<p><a href="http://webkit.org/blog/86/box-shadow/">-webkit-box-shadow</a> creates shadows. <a href="http://www.css3.info/preview/rounded-border/">-webkit-border-radius</a> creates rounded corners.</p>

<p>If you’re running Safari on Leopard (or probably any Safari 3 beta, or app that uses that same version of WebKit), and you’re on the <a href="http://inessential.com/">home page of this site</a>, you’ll see that each day has rounded corners at the top right and left and that each day casts a shadow. The page container also casts a shadow on the background graphic. And there’s a small shadow below the navigation links.</p>

<p>I’ve always went blech at the tricks people had to use to get rounded corners and shadows—hacks with images. Being able to do it with simple CSS is cool.</p>

<p>One thing I still want is gradients. The background at the top of this box should be a gradient. But it looks like I have to use an image for that. (Please correct me if I’m wrong!)
