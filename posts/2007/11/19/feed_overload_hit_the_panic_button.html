<a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2007/11/feed-overload-h.html">Nick Bradbury</a>: “The ‘panic button’ in this case is a feature I’ve added to the next pre-release of FeedDemon 2.6. FeedDemon will automatically detect when you’ve got a ton of unread items, and then offer to mark them (or a subset of them) as read.”</p>

<p>Great feature idea—I’ll probably lift it for NetNewsWire. (It won’t make it into 3.1, but hopefully the release after that.)
