What goes through my head as I watch a YouTube video:</p>

<p>(Times are in seconds.)</p>

<p>0:00: Is it working?</p>

<p>0:01: It’s working. Whoever sent me this link should be happy I’m actually watching it.</p>

<p>0:02: Is it finished yet?</p>

<p>0:03: Oh, that’s funny.</p>

<p>0:04: Finished? No?</p>

<p>0:05: I can’t remember, do I still have roast beef?</p>

<p>0:06: Oh look, Twitterrific updates.</p>

<p>0:07: Is this thing still playing?</p>

<p>0:08: I think it’s spaghetti night.</p>

<p>0:09: This has gone on for <i>hours</i> and shows no sign of stopping.</p>

<p>0:10: The video is stuck. Oh, not stuck.</p>

<p>0:11: Stuck again. Now not.</p>

<p>0:12: Oh look it’s kitty. [Opens window.]</p>

<p>0:13: If I use a relevance ranking cell, would that be confusing, since it’s not search results?</p>

<p>0:14: <i>Still</i> playing?</p>

<p>0:15: Oh yeah, funny, whatever.</p>

<p>0:16: This has been the longest day of my life.</p>

<p>0:17: I’m stopping it early. [Closes the page.]
