For the past week or so I’ve been running NetNewsWire in MallocDebug—I’m working on memory use. What I’ve found is that, at least for typical uses, WebKit uses most of the memory. (Images, especially. By the way, I’ve tried running with recent WebKit builds, and I’m excited—from my testing so far it appears that memory use is much improved. Looking good.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I just ran across the plugin-view of the beast, which sums up my feelings about plugins and the evil in their scummy hearts.</p>
