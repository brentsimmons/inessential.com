<a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/410/feeling-the-love">Red Sweater Blog</a>: “I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. MarsEdit <em>will make you a more prolific blogger</em>. I’ve seen it time and time again. I think it reduces the psychological burden of blogging.”</p>

<p>This was, in fact, the main goal of the original design of MarsEdit—to take any anxiety away by making it feel like just writing an email. Here are my original (long-ish) <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=2936">notes on the MarsEdit user interface</a>, from October 2004.</p>

<p>People sometimes ask me, “Are you happy with how it’s worked out for MarsEdit?”</p>

<p>The answer is: Yes! Daniel is doing great work, and I’m an enthusiastic MarsEdit 2.0 user. I’m looking forward to 3.0—it’s gonna be cool.
