Nick Bradbury, <a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2007/10/feeddemon-netne.html">FeedDemon, NetNewsWire and NewsGator Inbox to Support APML</a>: “This means you’ll be able to share your attention data not only between our tools, but also with any service that supports APML. Our hope is that by supporting APML, more third parties will be convinced to support it.”</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://blogs.newsgator.com/inbox/2007/10/newsgator-inbox.html">Nick Harris</a> and Nick Bradbury for looking into this. APML wasn’t on my radar, but I agree that a common format for attention data is a very good thing.
