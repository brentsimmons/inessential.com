<a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2007/02/holy_rush.html">Nick Bradbury</a>: “My family moved to Tennessee when I entered my teen years, and it was there that I met my first true love. She was a southern girl whose father was a fire-and-brimstone minister. I was 16 at the time, and to prove my devotion to her I agreed to attend one of her father’s church services.”
