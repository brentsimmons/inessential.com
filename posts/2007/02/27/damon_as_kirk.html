<a href="http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=3&id=40315">SCI FI Wire</a>: “On Feb. 26, IGN.com reported a rumor that Matt Damon was under consideration for the role of Kirk, Oscar winner Adrien Brody was being eyed to play Spock and Gary Sinise was being mulled to play Dr. Leonard McCoy.”</p>

<p>I could take Matt Damon as Kirk. It’s Ben Affleck as Kirk that gives me the heebie-jeebies.
