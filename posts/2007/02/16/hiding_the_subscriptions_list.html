One of my personal favorite new features is the ability to hide the subscriptions list. It gives you more room when you’re viewing a web page—or you can even use NetNewsWire as a single-pane aggregator.</p>

<p>A couple screen shots:</p>

<p>You can hide and show the subscriptions list manually via the View menu: choose <code>Hide Subscriptions List</code> (or Show, of course, depending on its state). It has the same keyboard shortcut as Mail has for showing/hiding mailboxes.</p>

<p>The way I use it is to have it hidden and show automatically. When viewing a web page, it hides. When viewing a news item, it shows. Choose <code>View > Automatically Hide Subscriptions</code>.
