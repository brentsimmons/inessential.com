I just posted NetNewsWire 3.0d46, a new sneak-peek release of NetNewsWire. Important: it’s not even a beta: there are more features to do, and it definitely has bugs. The “d” stands for <i>danger.</i></p>

<p>You can <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php">download</a> it from the beta page. <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire3.0d46.php">Read the change notes</a> to find out the full scoop.</p>

<p>I’m hugely excited about NetNewsWire 3. Even though there’s still a lot to do, I wanted to get it out there because, well, I can’t stand the thought that you’re not using it. ;) (But, beware, I’m serious about the danger thing, so don’t use it if you’re not comfortable running software that’s clearly unfinished and has bugs.)</p>

<p>There are a ton of changes, not all of them visible or obvious. I’m going to take a break from programming for the next few days and write about some of these changes.</p>

<p>In the meantime, here’s a screenshot. (Click on the thumbnail.)</p>
