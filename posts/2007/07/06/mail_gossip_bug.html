Here’s my favorite Mail bug...</p>

<p>Say I get an email, and I do a reply-all. The to and cc list look like this (only less fuzzy):</p>

<p><img src="http://inessential.com/images/mailcclist.png" alt="Mail CC list" height="120" width="376" /></p>

<p>So I’m like—cool, I can talk about the Nicks, since they’re not getting this email. I start typing, gossip gossip gossip, blah blah blah.</p>

<p>Then I send it, and <em>the Nicks get the email</em>, and then the whirring blades disperse the waste into the atmosphere...</p>

<p>In real life I’m not some big email-gossip, so this hasn’t actually happened. To me.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing—in this fictional situation, I didn’t check the cc list. If I had clicked in it, then typed down arrow a few times, I would have seen the rest of the cc list, and I would have known the Nicks were on the list.</p>

<p><img src="http://inessential.com/images/mailcclist2.png" alt="Mail CC list " height="120" width="383" /></p>

<p>But there’s nothing to indicate that there are more people on the cc list. The scroll thumb doesn’t actually appear—in fact, the <em>absence of the thumb indicates that the entire list is visible</em>.</p>

<p>But it’s not.</p>

<p><i>Update 1:00 p.m.:</i> This may happen only if you have the scrollbar setting for both-arrows-at-both-ends turned on, which I do.
