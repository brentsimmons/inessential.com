Paul Kafasis: <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/posts/Article/More-Mail-Followup-2007-07-06-21-00.html">More Follow-up To Mail, The OS And Frameworks</a>: “What I think is important is the idea of Apple providing more backend engines, upon which front-ends can be built. MailKit is a great example of that, but a FinderKit (for replacing the Finder), a MediaKit (for audio), and so on, could also be quite useful.”
