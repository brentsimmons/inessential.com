<a href="http://www.theronge.com/2007/07/07/kiwi-going-closed-source-mailcore-will-remain-open/">Ronge</a>: “With talk of email clients in the air, I started seriously thinking about making Kiwi closed source, something I have been considering for 6 months.”</p>

<p>Whether or not Kiwi is closed or open doesn’t matter much to me personally—what I want is a great email app, and I’m certainly willing to pay for it.</p>

<p>(To be clear: I’m a proponent of open source. But I&#160;don’t think every app has to be open source.)
