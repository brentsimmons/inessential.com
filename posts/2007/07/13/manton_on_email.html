Manton Reece: <a href="http://www.manton.org/2007/07/professional_email.html">Professional email app</a>: “I started writing an email client last year and worked on it in my spare time for a couple of months before abandoning it. It added a few new twists that other clients don’t have, including a server component in an attempt to embrace the benefits of both Gmail (access anywhere, automatic sync) and a native Mac client (better UI).”
