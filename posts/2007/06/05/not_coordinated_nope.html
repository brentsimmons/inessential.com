People have asked if Daniel Jalkut and I coordinated the simultaneous releases of <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/346/marsedit-12-growl-picasa-and-vox">MarsEdit 1.2</a> and <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/">NetNewsWire 3.0</a>. We didn’t, even though we do often exchange email.</p>

<p>Sheila said to me that it must have made me feel good to see both apps come out on the same day, that I must feel like I did the right thing with MarsEdit. Yep—she’s absolutely right.
