I was looking at the comments on TUAW’s coverage of the <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/04/12/apple-announces-leopard-delays-due-to-the-iphone/">Leopard-delayed-till-October</a> news.</p>

<p>Some selections: “*cry*” “Noooooooohohoho!!!! Waaaaah!!!! Tears form in my eyes (for real).” “Unbelievable & sad.” “I just died inside. I have no words to express my grief.”</p>

<p>Not <i>all</i> the comments are as silly—but still, I have to wonder about people who proclaim, even hyperbolically, that it’s making them cry. Developers doing a Leopard-only release—I can understand their being upset, because it means they can’t ship until October. But other folks? Tears? Really? 10.4 is such a burden to use, we can barely stand it?</p>

<p>(I wonder if the fashion treadmill is a mistake, kind of like using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Genesis">protomatter in the Genesis matrix</a>. Eventually it blows up, even if early results are spectacular.)</p>

<p>Anyway—take it from me, a veteran of 27 years of Apple OS upgrades. A few extra months will be okay. ;)
