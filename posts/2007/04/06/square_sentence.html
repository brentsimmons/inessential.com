Here’s how I know I’m a geek.</p>

<p>It’s been years since I’ve been on the Paris M&eacute;tro, but I still remember a little sign that was in the subway cars: <i>tout abus sera puni</i>.</p>

<p>I don’t remember that phrase for what it says—I translate it as “all abuses will be punished”—but for its mathematical properties.</p>

<p>tout abus sera puni: four words, 16 letters. Four letters per word: two consonants and two vowels.</p>

<p>It’s a square sentence, if there is such a thing. And, as such, I’ve always remembered it, and I always remember sitting or standing in the subway and being fascinated by it.</p>

<p>If I were one of those authors of Templar/Mason/Grail conspiracy novels, I’d probably use this as a coded message of some kind. The sacred 4 x 4 clue printed all over “underground” Paris, with a bland message that should really be translated more grandiosely as a clue to what we will do to our enemies, the heirs to the Spanish Inquisition, or whatever.
