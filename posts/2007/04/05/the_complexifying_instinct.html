Sometimes I wonder about the complexifying instinct.</p>

<p>Entropy for software isn’t disorder—it’s more features. It’s caused by people wanting more features. And wanting them quite reasonably and intelligently: wanting good and useful features.</p>

<p>Think of the initial appeal of Blogger: you type into some little text field, and it appears on the web, and everyone can read it. Easy and delightful.</p>

<p>But blogging didn’t stop there, because people quite reasonably wanted to have titles. Sure, titles, of course, we need titles, I agree.</p>

<p>And then, of course, Slashdot had departments, so don’t weblogs need categories or something like that? A weblog is a kind of knowledge management app, after all, and categories are a pretty lightweight addition. Okay, sure, categories, let’s add ’em.</p>

<p>How about summaries? Sure thing. And hierarchical categories? Trackbacks? Ja. A setting for enabling comments. A setting for appearing on the home page. Sure, sure, everything’s reasonable—everything’s <i>needed</i>, even. Extended entries. Tags. Enclosures. Yes.</p>

<p>The only thing that’s lost is the sheer delight of that simple text field for posting to the web.</p>

<p>So then there’s <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, which is, basically, a service where you type into some little text field, and it appears on the web, and everyone can read it. Easy and delightful.</p>

<p>Sometimes I see feature requests for Twitter, and this makes me nervous. I hope that it adds zero features.</p>

<p>Even if weblog writing has turned baroque, there should be space for at least one thing on the web that stays simple and fun.</p>

<p>If weblogs are the city of the web, then Twitter is the lone tree on the prairie, cool for just standing there among the grasses, a home for birds.
