<blockquote>As <a href="http://jeffnolan.com/wp/2007/11/29/converting-the-faithful/">some have noticed</a>, and others have <a href="http://twitter.com/brentsimmons/statuses/476557432">gloated about</a> :-), I’ve been using a Mac (specifically a Macbook Pro) as my primary machine for about a month now. I’ve been a died-in-the-wool Windows guy every since Windows 3.0, and scoffed at all of the people playing with their silly Macs. Well, I guess they showed me, because now I’m using one. I’m even writing this post in <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>.</blockquote>
