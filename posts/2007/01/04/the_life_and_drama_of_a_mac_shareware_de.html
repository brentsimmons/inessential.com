Just a note of support for Jesse Grosjean, who wrote: <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/node/2016">The life and drama of a Mac shareware developer</a>: “Today is one of the best and worst days of my shareware experience.”</p>

<p>I think he’s doing the right thing, and I want to congratulate him on the release of <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/product/writeroom">WriteRoom 2.0</a> and on marking the hard decision on setting pricing. None of this stuff is easy—and a well-done app with a responsive and responsible developer is easily worth the money.</p>

<p>Jesse didn’t quote <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000370/bio">Walt Disney</a>, so I’ll do it: “I don’t make pictures just to make money. I make money to make more pictures.” If Jesse’s like most Mac developers I know, he feels the same—he wants to make cool apps, and he makes money so he can keep making cool apps.
