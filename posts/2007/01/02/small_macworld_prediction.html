My small Macworld prediction is that Apple will announce the immediate availability of Beatles songs on iTMS.</p>

<p>(I just noticed that the built-in spelling dictionary marks “Beatles” as mis-spelled.)</p>

<p>Of course, if you’re like me, what you’re really waiting for is Led Zeppelin. Dude, totally.</p>

<p>(Since “led” and “zeppelin” are real words, they don’t get marked as mis-spelled. Def Leppard, on the other hand...)
