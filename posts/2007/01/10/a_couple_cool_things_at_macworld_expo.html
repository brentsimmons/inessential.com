One of my favorite things at Macworld Expo is seeing what other developers are up to. A couple things I saw today are especially worth mentioning:</p>

<p>1. <a href="http://www.stuntsoftware.com/">Stunt Software</a>. I hadn’t checked out their stuff before, but I got a quick demo from Dan—and, you know what, the software looks just plain hot. I totally dig it.</p>

<p>I recommend finding their booth if you’re here—and, if you’re not here, just get the apps from the website.</p>

<p>2. <a href="http://plasq.com/">Plasq</a>. You know Comic Life, of course—but they’re showing a new app that to my knowledge hasn’t been announced yet. An over-the-web collaboration thing that, well, rocks. Go find their booth.
