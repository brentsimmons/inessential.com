My cat Papa jumped up on the keyboard of my laptop and ran a Spotlight search. What was he looking for?</p>

<p>One theory was that the . represented a circular container and the /s represent tuna flakes which are stored in that container. (Note that it was 6:59 p.m., which is one minute prior to Tuna Time chez Papa.)</p>

<p>Another theory was that he was trying to run a script or app in the current directory—the ./ beginning suggests that—but that he, being a cat, laid on the / key too long.</p>

<p>A third theory is that the first two theories are way too literal, and whatever this meant, whatever he was looking for, it will forever remain opaque.</p>
