Whenever I see a new product from Apple, I wonder if there will be a Bobo Concept.</p>

<p>Here’s what I mean by bobo:</p>

<p>When I was in middle school, there were certain shirts, jeans, and sneakers you could wear. Lacoste; Levi’s and Lee; Nike, Puma, and Adidas.</p>

<p>Everything else was <i>bobo</i>. Shirts with a fox instead of an alligator? <i>Bobo</i>. Toughskins, Wranglers: bobo. Keds: bobo.</p>

<p>(As in, “Hey Simmons! Nice bobos! [Snicker.] You’re so cooooooool!”)</p>

<p>The iPod is clearly not bobo—but everything else is. Zune: bobo. Those other ones whose names I can’t even think of: bobo. The iPod is <i>the only non-bobo player</i>.</p>

<p>But Macs, on the other hand—well, I don’t think there’s a Bobo Concept for computers. (At least, not yet.)</p>

<p>Will there be a Bobo Concept for phones? Will the iPhone be the only non-bobo phone? (Or one of the very few.)</p>

<p>If so, then Apple is going to dominate. (If not, they may still do very damn well, of course.)</p>

<p>The thing about bobo is you can never predict what will happen. New products can change the rules: sometimes the definition of non-bobo stretches, sometimes it narrows.</p>

<p>For instance, designer jeans came out while I was in middle school—and suddenly we were having real debates over whether to accept Jordache, Calvin Klein, and Gloria Vanderbilt jeans as non-bobo. (Consensus eventually reached was that, due to price, those were non-bobo. But I don’t think we ever settled the issue of Britannia jeans, since they were less expensive. I thought they were bobo, because I was a bobo purist, but opinion was mixed.)</p>

<p>If I were 12 years old—or 17 or 21—I might look at the iPhone and think that every single other phone is bobo. (In fact, right now, this minute, I <i>do</i> think every single other phone is bobo.)</p>

<p>Bobo is a harsh mistress. The thing about bobo is, you’d rather die than own bobos. To own bobos is to <i>be</i> bobo—internally, yourself, voted off the island, not on the bus.
