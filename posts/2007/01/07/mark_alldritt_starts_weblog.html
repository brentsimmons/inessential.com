Mark Alldritt has been an indie-Mac-dev-hero of mine since the ’90s—he’s one of the people whose example led me to think that small companies and small teams can do great Mac software and make a living. And now Mark has started a weblog: <a href="http://www.latenightsw.com/blog/">Mark Alldritt’s Journal</a>. (Via <a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/">Michael Tsai</a>.)</p>

<p>You might wonder who were my other indie-Mac-dev-heroes back when I was starting out. I remember well. Along with Mark, they were: <a href="http://www.stairways.com/blog/">Peter Lewis</a>, <a href="http://www.glorifiedtypist.com/">Rich Siegel</a>, <a href="http://www.shotton.com/">Chuck Shotton</a>, and <a href="http://scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a>.</p>

<p>I went to work for one of my Mac heroes—Dave Winer at UserLand Software—for seven years!</p>

<p>(I still remember the first time I visited Dave Winer’s office and saw his Eddy Award statue. I thought to myself, one day I’m going to win one of those. That’s what I call “leadership by putting stuff on shelves.” ;)
