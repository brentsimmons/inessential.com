<a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2007/the-brent-simmons-interview/">Shawn Blanc interviewed me</a>. At some point I explain I’m a cat person. I get to mention a bunch of cool Mac apps.
There’s even a picture of my workspace in there—which I think is a first for me.</p>

<p>(Shawn’s cool—if he asks to interview you, don’t hesitate to say yes.)
