If cats were scientists—biologists, say—they’d be very <i>patient</i> scientists. They’d keep a clean bench—cleanliness is next to felis, after all—and they’d be very careful as they filled beakers and centrifuged things and ran blots and cared for their cell cultures and everything.</p>

<p>They’d be great scientists, I think. Until they knocked everything to the floor and chased it and bit it.
