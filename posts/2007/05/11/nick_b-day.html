Happy Birthday to Nick! He <a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2007/05/top_40.html">turns 40 today</a>.</p>

<p>Nick writes, “A few weeks ago I attended a ritzy charity event, and I swear half the people there—both men and women—had ridiculous stretched faces. They might as well had worn badges that said, ‘I paid a plastic surgeon a ton of money to look this silly.’ I sure as hell don’t want to get old like <i>that</i>.”
