Since starting at Omni late last September I’ve been working on OmniFocus 2.1 for Mac — and <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">today it shipped</a>. (It’s the first thing I’ve worked on at Omni to ship.)

The big changes are Yosemite-related: sharing menu, sharing and Today extensions, vibrant UI, new-style toolbar buttons, improved find-and-replace, and the tear-off view options popover. (Plus — my favorite — performance and stability fixes.)

OmniFocus, like every Omni app, is a team effort. It’s the work of engineers, designers, testers, project managers, writers, video-makers, and support humans — the whole company contributes, directly or indirectly, to every shipment.

While I’m proud of my work, I’m *way* more proud of the team’s work — because my work is just bits and pieces, and the team’s work is the entire app. And the app is good, and <a href="https://vimeo.com/114385112">I feel good</a>.
