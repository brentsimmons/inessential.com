Dave DeLong tweeted this morning that long-time Mac developer <a href="https://twitter.com/davedelong/status/647051405337866240">Rosyna Keller needs help</a>.

>I’m writing this now early Thursday morning from a Red Roof Inn, the safest place I’ve been since September 30th, 2013. I’ve only got a total of $0.06 left to my name and I only have a room here until 11am (Phoenix) on Thursday, September 24th, 2015. I have no idea what to do, I’m broke, and I’m hiding from <em>extremely</em> abusive family.

A necessary mark of a good community is that we help people who need help. Rosyna needs help.
