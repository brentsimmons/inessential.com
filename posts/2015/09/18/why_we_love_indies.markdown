What’s great about indies is that they can, and do, make *human* decisions that may upset people.

Large corporations may (and frequently do) upset people — but it’s rare that they do so out of a sense of ethics or morality. Quite the opposite.

So Marco says that keeping Peace on the App Store <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/09/18/just-doesnt-feel-good">just doesn’t feel good</a>. You may be upset by this.

But here’s the thing: we don’t love indies because they can do and say things that upset *other* people — we love indies because they can do and say things that upset *anybody*. Even you, even me.

You can see plain as day that there’s a human being there.

I have to admit, though, that I’m not upset, even though I was a Peace user. I stand up and applaud Marco’s courage and his decision.

>Agree or not, this is why small developers and individual voices are important. Big companies don't—can't—do this.
