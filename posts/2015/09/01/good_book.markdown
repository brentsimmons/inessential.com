My co-worker Curt Clifton <a href="https://twitter.com/curtclifton/status/638765286582185984">writes</a>:

> Anybody have a good source of sample problems? Project Euler is probably too mathy. Maybe a data structures book?

This would be for programmers at Omni, so think of the kinds of problems that people writing large Mac and iOS productivity apps need to solve.

(And <a href="https://twitter.com/curtclifton/status/638765286582185984">reply to Curt on Twitter</a> if you have a good idea. Thanks!)
