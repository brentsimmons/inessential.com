<a href="http://alexking.org/">My friend Alex King</a> died last night. He had been fighting cancer.

He was a good man. We should all be so good.

I’m thinking of his family. They’ll miss a husband and son and father. If there was any way to take some of that pain away, I would. So many people — everybody who knew Alex — would. I wish it worked that way.
