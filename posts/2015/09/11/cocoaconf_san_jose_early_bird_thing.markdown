My pal Solomon — Solly, Sol-meister, ol’ SK — just emailed me to remind you that the early bird sale for CocoaConf in San Jose ends Sept. 19th at midnight.

<a href="http://cocoaconf.com/sanjose-2015/schedule">Check out the schedule</a>. Laura Savino and Jaimee Newberry are both speaking, which is more than enough right there to get you to go. And there’s a whole mess of Daniel Steinberg on Swift, which you know you need. The unstoppable Marcus Zarra (I’ve tried to stop him; can’t be done) will be talking about Core Data. And there’s plenty more.

PS Actually, no, I haven’t tried to stop Marcus Zarra. Who would do that? It’s way more fun to encourage him.

PPS I’m speaking too, at the very end.
