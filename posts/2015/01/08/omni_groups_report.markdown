Ken published <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/blog/a-review-of-the-omni-groups-2014-and-our-plans-for-2015">Omni’s 2014 report plus 2015 plans</a> this morning.

The company did what it planned to do last year, plus more, and it was a record sales year for OmniFocus, OmniOutliner, and for the company in general.

The app I work on, OmniFocus for Mac, was mentioned a few times. It’s in the App Store’s Best of 2014 — no thanks to me. :) (None of my work on OmniFocus has shipped yet.)

Also:

>Yosemite brought a new look and feel to the Mac, so we’ll be updating all of our Mac apps to fit in well there. We started this process last year with OmniGraffle 6.1, but we’ll also be updating OmniFocus and OmniOutliner and OmniPlan. Yosemite also brought support for extensions similar to those on iOS 8, so we’ll be adding Today and Sharing extensions to OmniFocus for Mac when we update its interface.

And:

>OmniFocus 2 has been very well-received—setting a sales record in 2014—but in no way does that mean we think it’s finished! We’ve been listening to your feedback, and we will continue to update the app to make it sync more responsively, to be easier to scan visually, and to be more efficient to use.

That’s where I come in — helping to make this all come true in 2015.
