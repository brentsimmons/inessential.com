The first of my work at Omni to get outside the office is the new <a href="http://omnistaging.omnigroup.com/omnifocus-2/">beta of OmniFocus 2.1 for Mac</a>.

Here are the <a href="http://update.omnigroup.com/releasenotes/omnifocus-2/OmniFocus-2.1.x-r224198-Test/">release notes</a>, and here’s a <a href="http://people.omnigroup.com/kc/images/preview-omnifocus-2.1-yosemite.png">screenshot</a>.

While this beta contains my work, and I’m proud of it, it’s not *all* my work — I’m one part of a big team that makes and supports great apps.

As always: if you have questions, problems, or feedback, please <a href="http://support.omnigroup.com">contact the Support Humans</a>. They’re great, and they make sure things get in the system so that everybody knows about them.
