Gus Mueller, <a href="http://shapeof.com/archives/2015/1/microsoft__apple__and_disappointment.html">Microsoft, Apple, and Disappointment</a>:

>Apple is your favorite aunt or uncle, who isn’t talking about crazy future ideas, but is instead showing you how to hold a pencil correctly, or a tie your shoe. Something you can do today. Apple isn’t flailing about trying to grab onto whatever it can so, yelling out for attention. Apple is solid, reliable, dependable.

>And I think that is why we’re seeing so many people reacting to Apple’s software quality lately. You expect Microsoft not to deliver. But we expect Apple to.
