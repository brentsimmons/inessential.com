There are so many new buildings going up in Seattle — Boomtown — especially around South Lake Union where I work. And it seems that every in-progress building and every construction crane has a big blue 12 flag.

It makes me think of the religious art of the middle ages and Renaissance, except that our new civic religion is the Seahawks. As if all these buildings are going up as humble praise to our football team.

Which doesn’t make me sad. Go Hawks!
