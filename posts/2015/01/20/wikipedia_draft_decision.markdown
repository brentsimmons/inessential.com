Wikipedia’s Arbitration Committee [ArbCom] on Gamergate has produced a draft decision. <a href="http://www.markbernstein.org/Jan15/Infamous.html">Mark Bernstein writes</a>:

>By my informal count, <em>every</em> feminist active in the area is to be sanctioned. This takes care of social justice warriors with a vengeance — not only do the GamerGaters get to rewrite their own page (and Zoe Quinn’s, Brianna Wu’s, Anita Sarkeesian’s, etc.); feminists are to be purged <em>en bloc</em> from the encyclopedia. Liberals are the new Scientologists as far as Arbcom is concerned.
