From the <a href="http://seoulbrother.tumblr.com/post/130304167920/mandatory-10-day-suspension-of-all-firearm-and">text of the initiative</a>:

>Firearm and ammunition sales have consistently seen boosts in sales after high-profile incidents involving gun violence. It’s known as “the Sandy Hook Effect,” a reference to increased sales and NRA memberships after the 2012 Newtown, Connecticut massacre. These “bumps” allow firearm companies and the gun lobby to profit from these tragedies.

Show me where to sign.
