I got email from my Dad where he describes a bug in Mail on El Capitan and how he solved it by going back to Yosemite.

>I was never able to get Mail to work. In the end, it was a resource hog. Somehow between Yosemite on September 28 and yesterday, my available storage space went from 71GB to 3GB (on a 320GB hard drive). For the last week and a half, I could not even open mail with El Capitan. Even in “safe” mode, I could not get Mail to work.

>…So, I am living with Yosemite, and it works fine.

Last night I edited the Safari bookmarks on my development machine. The changes didn’t sync to my laptop.

I gave it overnight — they still haven’t synced. I tried turning Safari syncing on and off, on both machines, and that didn’t help. I ended up making the changes manually on my laptop to match my development machine.

A week ago I wanted to stream the latest Doctor Who to my laptop. I launched iTunes and started watching. It got about a minute in — and then it stopped. I clicked some buttons, but nothing helped. It was stuck.

Finally it occurred to me that perhaps something was using my bandwidth and preventing streaming from working. I was right: it was iTunes — *the same app on the same computer* — downloading a bunch of podcasts. I paused the downloads, and then streaming worked.

Why wouldn’t iTunes prioritize streaming? Surely it could notice that someone is watching a thing, and notice that it’s stuck, and then just pause other downloads. Not everybody is going to figure out how to deal with this manually.

Every day, on multiple computers, in Notification Center, I have to click to allow Weather to use my location. Why would it forget that I already said yes?

There’s a reason, I’m sure, and I bet there’s an easy fix.

My point is that this shouldn’t be allowed to get into a state where it’s annoying.

So we have Apple Watch and Apple TV now. What I’m hoping for — what I’m nearly begging for, more as a user than as developer — is that Apple spend a year making things *better*. Nothing new. Just make things work better.
