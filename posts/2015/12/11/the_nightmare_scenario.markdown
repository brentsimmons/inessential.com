The Republican presidential candidates can be divided into two categories: Lying Panderers Who Are Deeply Wrong about Pretty Much Everything (LPs), and Actual Fascists.

#### LPs

- Marco Rubio
- Jeb Bush
- Carly Fiorina
- Chris Christie
- Lindsey Graham
- Rick Santorum
- Mike Huckabee
- John Kasich
- Rand Paul
- George Pataki
- Jim Gilmore

#### Actual Fascists

- Donald Trump
- Ben Carson
- Ted Cruz

(Note: I waffle on Huckabee. Perhaps he should be listed in Actual Fascists — but it doesn’t matter, as we’ll see in a second.)

### Chances

There’s another way to categorize the candidates: those who have no chance to win the nomination and those who might win.

#### No Chance

- Jeb Bush
- Carly Fiorina
- Chris Christie
- Lindsey Graham
- Rick Santorum
- Mike Huckabee
- John Kasich
- Rand Paul
- George Pataki
- Jim Gilmore
- Ben Carson

Bush is a remarkably awful candidate. Fiorina gets some support after each debate, and then it vanishes as everybody forgets about her. Christie is a mean kid from *New Jersey*. Graham doesn’t excite anybody but John McCain. Santorum is a whiny has-been. Huckabee no longer seems like the nice evangelical that people liked last time he ran. Kasich is borderline not-insane, which is disqualifying. Paul doesn’t like killing people nearly enough. Pataki has a weird name and he’s from *New York*. Gilmore is completely unknown. Carson makes even crazy people worry about his mental faculties.

This leaves…

#### Might Win

- Marco Rubio
- Donald Trump
- Ted Cruz

If their chances are equal, then that means there’s a two-thirds chance that the Republican nominee will be an Actual Fascist.

But their chances may not be equal. Slate posted a piece on Rubio that suggests he’s [pretty bad at running for the nomination](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/marco_rubio_s_organization_isn_t_nearly_as_good_as_his_opponents_the_florida.html).

There’s your nightmare scenario. All it takes to get an Actual Fascist as the nominee is for Rubio to suck at this. And there’s some indication that he *does*.

### Nightmare Scenario, Part Two

Let’s give the Republican nominee a made-up name so we can refer to him: Crump.

Crump wins the nomination and starts running a general election campaign against Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee.

Clinton is kicking Crump’s ass all over the map (except for the South, and even there it’s close in a few states).

And then Something Happens. Could be something international, could be something with the economy, could be a scandal, could be a combination of things — we don’t know. But this Something sticks to Hillary and she loses the general election.

Here’s the thing: sometimes something *does* happen. Not always, but sometimes. And you can bet that there will be legions of well-funded people trying to *make* something happen.

And then we have President Crump, an Actual Fascist.

What separates where we are right now from that outcome is not damn much.
