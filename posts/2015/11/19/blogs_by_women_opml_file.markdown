In <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/11/16/blogs_by_women">Blogs by Women</a> I presented a list of blogs of interest to Mac and iOS developers, designers, and power users that are written by women.

Today I created an OPML file — you can import it into your RSS reader to add these as subscriptions.

If your reader can take a URL, copy this URL: http://ranchero.com/downloads/Mac-iOS-Tech-Blogs-By-Women.opml

If your reader needs a file, then <a href="http://ranchero.com/downloads/Mac-iOS-Tech-Blogs-By-Women.opml">download this file</a> and import it.

I was able to find feeds for all but three of the blogs on the list. That’s pretty good — but it ought to be 100%. Having a feed is *hugely important* if you want people to keep up with your blog.

>Blogging isn’t difficult, but it’s still not yet as easy as tweeting. By creating a blog, you’re making a statement that you <em>care</em> about something.

In the immortal words of Andy Gibb: you should be bloggin’.
