The other day, my friend — who’s enjoying being a hermit lately, and asked not to be named — expressed a wish to know more pop songs. I said I could come up with a list of 12 worth knowing.

It isn’t *the* list. It’s *a* list.

Every one of these can still give me chills (in the best way).
In no particular order:

[Under the Milky Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6jhpaX7fNQ) by the Church.

[A Pair of Brown Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=421pZgg-vlY) by the Pogues.

[Spanish Bombs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ertt3o1x65c) by the Clash.

[Brimful of Asha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM7H0ooV_o8) by Cornershop. “Asha” means hope, and the reference to “45” is a reference to pop songs. I once did a talk that used this song — it was about how apps are the new pop songs. (Imagine the call-out at the end, but with The Iconfactory, Panic, Omni, Tapbots, and so on.) Sometimes I think this is my favorite song of all songs ever.

[Here Comes Your Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPgf_btTFlc) by the Pixies. Bonus points: [Gigantic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJncHEZ3URs) and [Monkey Gone to Heaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZemsK8b3m0).

[Just Like Heaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ar3gpz9HXjc) by the Cure.

[Fade Into You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uJ61jgFCMM) by Mazzy Star.

[Love Will Tear Us Apart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuObGsB0No) by Joy Division.

[What’s the Matter Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m39DWVFK-Bw) by 10,000 Maniacs. I’m in tears by “Oh these cold, and rude, things that you do…”

[See How We Are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADmUT7dCDi8) by X.

[Sweet Jane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkumhBVPGdg) by the Velvet Underground. Bonus points: [Cowboy Junkies cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4XVJj4jER4). “Everyone who had a heart — they wouldn’t turn ’round and break it. Everyone who played a part — they wouldn’t turn ’round and hate it.”

[Ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pr6SxJb-Dw) by New Order.

All of these except for Ceremony are great for one guitar and singer (or singers). They could all be modern folk songs.

I include Ceremony anyway because it’s a miracle.

*Update 3:10 pm:* <a href="https://twitter.com/noir">Nick Arnott</a> created a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/tehnoir/playlist/6bmj9dfV9tcCEu3uigzpVe) and an [iTunes Music playlist](https://itunes.apple.com/us/playlist/inessential-pop/idpl.da65b03f7e0047a98cc9976dd7092116).

*Update 3:13 pm:* [Brimful of Asha, explained](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/8/7/12518/77483).

*Update 3:30 pm:* <a href="https://twitter.com/isaiah">Isaiah</a> made an <a href="https://t.co/uw9hLytWYx">Rdio playlist</a>.

*Update 4:55 pm:* <a href="http://yourhead.tumblr.com/post/132903839016/innessential-b-sides-sort-of">Isaiah made his own list</a>. A whole bunch of his songs could have been on my list. (A Message to You Rudy, especially. And the Buzzcocks. And Billy Bragg. And Iggy, though I might have gone with The Passenger. For the Smiths it would have been Panic instead of How Soon Is Now.)
