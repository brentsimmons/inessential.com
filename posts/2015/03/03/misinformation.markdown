>To this day, there will be at least one conference a year where someone will walk up to me and say, “So about that blog post that Brent wrote…”

I bet they say “Brett,” actually. They think it was Brett Terpstra. :)

The response <a href="http://inessential.com/2010/02/26/on_switching_away_from_core_data">to that post</a> continues to amaze me. I come right out and say, multiple times, that you should use Core Data. And yet it’s used as a thing about how Core Data sucks.

It doesn’t suck. Since writing that post I’ve shipped at least one app that used Core Data.

And: the problems I had with it five years ago aren’t particularly relevant now. Core Data has improved since then with new features that deal with some of the problems I had — and devices have gotten so very much faster since then.
