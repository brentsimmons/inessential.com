Back when Russian communism was still a thing, sometimes here in the States we’d hear of the jokes Russians told each other. (“In Soviet Union, TV watches you!”)

And we’d think that our system was better since we didn’t have to joke that way. And we were right.

But today I heard: “It’s not NSApplication — it’s NSA-pplication!” (See <a href="http://furbo.org/2015/03/10/xcode-compromised/">today’s news.</a>)

We make Russian jokes now.
