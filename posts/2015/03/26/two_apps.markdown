My friends Chris Parrish and Guy English <a href="http://aged-and-distilled.com">just released Napkin 1.5</a>, a huge update to their already-awesome visual markup app.

And cousin Michael and team <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">just released Fantastical 2.0</a>. You already know about it and you’ve bought it. I’m just reminding you that you have good taste. :)
