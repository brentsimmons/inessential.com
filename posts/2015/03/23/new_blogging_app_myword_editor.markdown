<a href="http://scripting.com/2015/03/23/mywordEditorIsOpenSource.html">MyWord Editor</a>, from Dave Winer, is a “a simple silo-free blogging tool that creates beautiful essay pages.” It’s <a href="https://github.com/scripting/myWordEditor">open source</a>.

The announcement page has an aside about RSS that I enjoyed:

>Of course every MyWord user has a great full-featured <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> 2.0 feed. We love RSS and it feeds us and we feed it, it's doing great, and <a href="http://littlecardeditor.com/users/davewiner/cards/2015/03/16/dontBeAWea188.html">anyone</a> who disses it is a mean rotten silo-lover.
