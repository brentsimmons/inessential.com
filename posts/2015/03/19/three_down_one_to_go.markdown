I was an Omni fan for many years before joining the company. It’s not just because the apps are so good — it’s also because it works like this: imagine what the right thing to do is, then watch Omni do it.

Right now the right thing, for our users and for the good of the apps, is to make them all universal — and as free upgrades for the iPad versions.

We <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/blog/omnioutliner-for-ios-now-available-on-iphone-and-ipad">just released OmniOutliner universal</a>. It joins OmniGraffle and OmniPlan — with OmniFocus next. (Which people all around me are working on.)

We’re on a roll.

(Me, I’m not helping at all with this universal stuff. I take no personal credit. I’m in Mac-land — my home! — doing Yosemite updates and fixing bugs.)
