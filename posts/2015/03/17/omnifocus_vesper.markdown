<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-2/id867299399?mt=12">OmniFocus 2.1.1 for Mac</a> shipped yesterday with some crashing bug fixes.

And a <a href="http://vesperapp.co/">universal version of Vesper</a> shipped a couple weeks ago.

If you’re counting — and of course you’re not — that’s three shipments I’ve been involved in this year so far (counting the earlier OmniFocus 2.1). I’ve got a busy year planned. With perhaps a surprise in there. Feels good.

(“Feels good,” I say — I’m trying to give myself a pep talk. I’m home with a head cold, and everything feels *bad* at the moment.)

PS I’m working right now on a Yosemite update for OmniOutliner. OmniOutliner for Mac has been and remains my very favorite Omni app.

And that’s in part because I love outliners. My history with outliners goes back to 1995. (Example: <a href="https://github.com/scripting/frontier/blob/master/Common/source/opxml.c">15 years ago I wrote C code for reading/writing OPML</a>. I don’t link to it because there’s something to learn from the code — there isn’t — it’s just remarkable to me that I’ve been doing this kind of thing for so many years. It’s because I like it.)
