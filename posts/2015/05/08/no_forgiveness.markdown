I was a fan of Alex Rodriguez when he was a Mariner. And I would have remained a fan when he left for the Rangers — because that’s baseball. Good and beloved players sometimes change teams. I remained a fan of Ken Griffey, Jr., Randy Johnson, and Ichiro Suzuki after they switched teams.

<a href="http://www.komonews.com/news/archive/4000236.html">But there was this</a> in 2001:

>A-Rod believes Boeing should follow him to Texas. That comment from the former Mariners shortstop came up during a segment of CNBC’s show “Squawk Box” featuring Boeing Chairman and CEO Phil Condit.

>A-Rod was quoted on the show as making this pitch to Boeing, “I moved to Dallas-Ft. Worth to improve my future… so should you.”

It’s one thing to move to another team and say goodbye to your fans — those fans who were the first to cheer for you — many of whom were Boeing employees. It’s quite another thing to take a shot at the livelihood of those fans. What an insult.

Fuck him. I’m still disgusted. And I was not surprised to find out he was a cheater.

Not a man.
