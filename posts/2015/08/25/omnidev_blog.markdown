At Omni we <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/developer/">started a new blog</a>. (With an [RSS feed](https://www.omnigroup.com/developer/rss/).)

I wrote an article: [Making Tab-Switching and Scrolling Faster in OmniFocus for Mac](https://www.omnigroup.com/developer/making-tab-switching-and-scrolling-faster-in-omnifocus-for-mac).

And Tim Ekl has written the first two parts of a series on building push-triggered sync:

[Building Push-Triggered Sync, Part One: Choosing a Language](https://www.omnigroup.com/developer/building-push-triggered-sync-part-one-choosing-a-language)

[Building Push-Triggered Sync, Part Two: First Steps](https://www.omnigroup.com/developer/building-push-triggered-sync-part-two-first-steps)

Whistle-whetter: we’re using Go. Read all about it.

PS I’ve been on my yearly beach vacation. Back now.
