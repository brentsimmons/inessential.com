My friend and co-worker at Omni Dan Segars released <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spotfunds/id908020085?mt=8">SpotFunds</a>, his first iPhone app, not long ago.

Keep track of just how much you’re spending on coffee (and similar). It’s an absurdly high amount. But you won’t know that till you get SpotFunds — the $3.99 app that <em>saves you money</em>.

(Note to Dan: there’s your marketing text, right there.)
