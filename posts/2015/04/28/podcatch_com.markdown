Dave Winer’s idea was to build a system where his friends could recommend specific episodes of a podcast and they’d be displayed on a single page. And then you can <a href="http://podcatch.com/">listen to things</a> — good things, hopefully — that you wouldn’t have heard otherwise.

If you’re in a podcast bubble, this is a way out.
