Last year’s conference was fantastic, and I expect no less this time.

Speakers include folks like Aaron Hillegass (who taught me how to write Cocoa apps, through his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cocoa-Programming-Mac-OS-3rd/dp/0321503619/">book</a>), Mike Lee, Andy Ihnatko, Erica Sadun, and local luminary Daniel Pasco (who’s written code that runs in <em>outer space</em>).

Note: <a href="http://iphonespring2011.crowdvine.com/">early-bird pricing</a> (save $200) expires Friday.
