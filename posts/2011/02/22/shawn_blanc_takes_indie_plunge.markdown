Shawn Blanc begins the <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2011/02/beginning/">Beginning</a>: “This is a sentence I never thought I would publish: Beginning the first week in April I will be writing shawnblanc.net as my full-time gig.”

Congratulations and best wishes to Shawn! I’ve enjoyed his weblog for years.
