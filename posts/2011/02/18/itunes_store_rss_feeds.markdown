Want to see new music releases, or top 50 free Mac apps, or whatever? Apple’s <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/rss">iTunes RSS Generator</a> generates feeds for the iTunes Store

I just stared using it myself. I’ve got feeds for the top free and paid Mac apps. As a long-time Mac developer, I’m fascinated by the Mac App Store. And like everybody else I like knowing when there’s something new and cool.
