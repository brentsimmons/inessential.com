Mike Ash: <a href="http://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2011-02-18-compound-literals.html">Friday Q&A 2011-02-18: Compound Literals</a>: “Although Cocoa takes care of its most common types with NSMakeRect and friends, there are still places to put compound literals to good use.”

There’s a good chance I’ll use this a ton with NSRect and CGRect.
