Karelia Software just <a href="http://www.sandvox.com/">released Sandvox 2</a>. It’s a website creator — and very much a traditional Mac app in the best sense: instead of being all about coding, it’s all about making a website.

You choose from templates, drag-and-drop pictures and video from your library, add your own words, create your own designs, publish to a server, all without having to know any HTML. (But, of course, you <em>can</em> write HTML too, if you want.)

There’s a coupon code: 20% off for readers of my weblog, good through May 20. Use the code <code>INESSENTIAL</code>.
