My friends at RogueSheep <a href="http://blog.roguesheep.com/2011/05/03/touchup-for-ipad-1-2/">released TouchUp 1.2</a> a week ago — and I was a little busy at that moment and missed linking to it.

It’s a cool update to a cool app. New features include deeper Flickr integration, new filters such as Pixelate and Vignette, and support for AirPrint.

The app is gorgeous, and it’s one of those great apps that make the iPad a <em>creation</em> device, not just a fancy movie-player.
