I’m so excited to see <a href="http://tumultco.com/hype/">Hype</a> released. It’s what we’ve <em>needed</em>.

I can write code. Not scared. Do it all the time. But if an app means I don’t have to, and I can iterate faster, and do things I haven’t learned how to code yet... then I love that app. Which I do.
