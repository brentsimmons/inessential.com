It happened a few days ago, and I was heads-down, so I missed it. If by any chance you missed all the other links to Fantastical, <a href="http://flexibits.com/fantastical">here’s another one</a>.

Half of Flexibits is Michael Simmons. There are those who say we’re cousins, some who say we’re brothers. (Our origins are shrouded in mystery, but I can say that we were both at hand for the invention of papyrus. And Pythagoras stole Michael’s idea, for which he’s still a bit miffed.)

I like to think I’m Michael’s evil twin. But I have more hair, so there’s that.

Family business aside. Fantastical makes dealing with your calendar less tyrannical. Enter new calendar entries using English, instead of beating up your tendons with a bunch of mousing and clicking and mis-mousing and mis-clicking.

When I say “English” I don’t mean AppleScript English — I mean the real thing. It works! Feels like deep magic from beyond the dawn of time.

And the app looks great. It’s a pleasure to use.
