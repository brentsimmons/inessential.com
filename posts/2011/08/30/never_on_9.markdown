I was listening to the <a href="http://yourmaclifeshow.com/archives/2011/08/24/steve-jobs-resigns-apple">Your Mac Life podcast from August 24</a> — and NetNewsWire came up. “That takes me back to OS 9!”

Just FYI, to the world (not that it’s earth-shattering information or anything): the first OS that NetNewsWire ran on was 10.1. It started life a Cocoa app, a Mac OS X app.

(I did write software back in the Mac Toolbox days, yes, but NetNewsWire was Cocoa from day one.)
