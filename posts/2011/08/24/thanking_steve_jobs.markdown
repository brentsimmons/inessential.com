I wrote a <a href="http://glassboard.com/blog/?p=80">thank-you to Steve Jobs</a> on the Glassboard website for the company.

Writing a personal thank-you escapes me for now. Too hard. I’ve been a fan since I got my first Apple II Plus, 31 years ago, when I was just 12 years old. That’s a long time. My life wasn’t changed so much as <em>defined</em>, given a shape and a mission and a sense of humanity. How do you thank for something that big?
