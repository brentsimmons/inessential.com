I agree most strenuously with Tim Bray on the issue of curly <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2011/11/17/Quotes">quotes</a>.

When you don’t use them, I think you’re an amateur. (I make an exception for email and chat, of course. And for Twitter, but only reluctantly.)

Where I differ is with the idea of <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2011/11/19/Quotes-Followup">remapping the keystrokes</a>. While the standard keystrokes are slightly more painful, they’re surprisingly learnable and easy-to-use once learned. (I learned the keystrokes in 1989, back in my days laying out the college paper with QuarkXPress. <a href="http://www.newcitycollegian.com/">City Collegian</a> forever!)

And, once learned, you don’t have to worry about your next machine, the computer you’re borrowing, and so on. It’s not bad. The keystrokes even start to feel natural. (Well, after a few years, okay, yes.)
