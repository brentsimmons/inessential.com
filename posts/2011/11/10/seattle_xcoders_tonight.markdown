<a href="http://seattlexcoders.org/2011/09/29/nov-10-meeting.html">Tonight’s Xcoders meeting</a> is on “Bridging the Gap: Hybrid iOS Apps.” It’s at the Facebook offices, and the after-meeting will be at the Cyclops.

(This is one of my favorite topics, but unfortunately I’ll have to miss it tonight.)
