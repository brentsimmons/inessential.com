A List Apart: <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/getting-started-with-sass/">Getting Started with Sass</a>: “Unlike regular CSS, Sass’ SCSS is a real scripting language, with expressions, functions, variables, conditional logic, and loops.”

It compiles to CSS. So sensible. Why work harder than you have to?
