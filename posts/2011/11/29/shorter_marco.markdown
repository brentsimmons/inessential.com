A synopsis of <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/11/29/parislemon-slideshow-articles">Marco on The Article As A Slideshow</a> would be this: <em>there will always be shitheads</em>. And being a shithead will be profitable.

Our job is not to become a shithead, whether by the slow drip of bad compromises or under the weight of the wheelbarrow of money. (The wheelbarrow of money is, by the way, almost non-existent compared to the slow drip, which drips everywhere.)
