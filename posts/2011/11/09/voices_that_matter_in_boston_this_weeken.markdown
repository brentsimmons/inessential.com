I’m looking forward to Voices that Matter in Boston this weekend. I’ve been to a couple in Seattle: I learned a lot, met people, and had a great time.

I’m doing two things at the conference: giving the closing address (“Beyond the Gold Rush”) and emceeing the UI Master Crit.  (Here’s the <a href="http://ios2011.voicesthatmatter.com/calendar">full schedule</a>. Lots of good speakers.)

The <a href="http://ios2011.voicesthatmatter.com/talks/20555">UI Master Crit</a> thing should be super-fun — people who have UI issues with their shipping apps get advice from masters of the craft Bill Van Hecke, Graeme Devine, and Jason Festa. (Awesome panel, right? So cool.)

If you haven’t registered, but you’d like to go, you should use the (case-sensitive) priority code BSTSPR7 to <a href="http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/ios2011/register.aspx">save $150</a>.
