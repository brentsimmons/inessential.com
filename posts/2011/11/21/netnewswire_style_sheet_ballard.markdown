Ballard, named for my awesome neighborhood in Seattle, is designed to be simple and easy-to-read. It uses Myriad for the title and headers if you have it, and Helvetica if you don’t. Body text is Palatino.

There are two versions:

1. <a href="http://inessential.com/downloads/Ballard_NNW3.3.nnwstyle.zip">For NetNewsWire 3.3</a>

2. <a href="http://inessential.com/downloads/Ballard_NNWLite4.nnwstyle.zip">For NetNewsWire Lite 4</a>

Many of the styles that come with NetNewsWire at the moment were designed when pixels were bigger, and so it would be a good idea to create some new styles.

Here’s a screen shot. Simple, yes? Yes.
