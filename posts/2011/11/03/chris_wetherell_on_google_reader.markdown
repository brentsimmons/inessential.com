In a post on Google+, <a href="https://plus.google.com/101851274707291135260/posts/FipoiXvRaa3">Chris (Google Reader co-founder) writes</a>:

>I suppose sacrificing pet projects, public responsibility, and transparency could be worth it if the end is a remarkable dream fulfilled. <em>But what if the thing you’re driving everyone toward isn’t the iPod but is instead the Zune</em>? So just make sure it's not <em>that</em>.

(Italics are from the original.)

Another good paragraph:

>However, saying “no” to projects doesn’t make you Steve Jobs if you say no to inspiring things. It’s the discernment that’s meaningful, not the refusal. Anyone can point their thumb to the ground.

And:

>Reader is (was?) for information junkies; not just tech nerds. This market <em>totally exists</em> and is weirdly under-served (and is possibly affluent).
