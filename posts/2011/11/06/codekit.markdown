<a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a> looks pretty cool and useful for web developers. I haven’t watched the videos — who has time for video? — but I was tempted enough to download it anyway. (It’s a beta.)

(Via <a href="http://tthor.com/">TThor</a>, which is just about the only thing to read on a Sunday. I wish it came out earlier in the day.)
