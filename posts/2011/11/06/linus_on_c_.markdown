I totally love this <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/57918">email by Linus Torvalds</a> from 2007.

>C++ is a horrible language. It's made more horrible by the fact that a lot 
of substandard programmers use it, to the point where it's much much 
easier to generate total and utter crap with it. Quite frankly, even if 
the choice of C were to do *nothing* but keep the C++ programmers out, 
that in itself would be a huge reason to use C.

You might agree or disagree. Me, I’ve managed to avoid C++ entirely, so I can’t say much about it, other than that it looks crazier than Perl. (People have said the same about Objective-C, of course.)

But I will admit to an enduring love of C. I still think of C not as C but as <em>the language</em>.
