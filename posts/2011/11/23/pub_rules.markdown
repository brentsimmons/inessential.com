I’d love to run, edit, and write for a publication bigger than just me and my blog. I don’t have time, so I won’t, at least not any time soon.

But if I were to run a publication, I’d have a few rules:

#### Design for reading

Obviously. See my <a href="http://inessential.com/2011/11/22/the_pummeling_pages">previous post</a>.

#### Design with little navigation

The way most people read is not to come to your home page and browse around. Instead, they get a link to an article via a feed, email, Twitter, Facebook, IM, and so on.

They’ll read that page and go. Close that browser tab. Putting up a whole bunch of navigation and call-outs to other sections of the site just makes the site junkier. There should be *some* navigation — particularly a way to get to the home page — but that’s about all that’s needed.

#### Forget any “social media strategy”

<em>Publish things so good that people want to share them.</em> That’s it.

No sharing buttons.

The site would have its own Twitter account and it would tweet a link to each new article. But that’s almost just like providing an RSS feed. (I’d probably automate this.)

#### Include full text in RSS feed (and no ads)

And no feedflare or any junk like that.

#### Design for performance

They’d most likely be static pages. If I decided to have comments — and I probably wouldn’t, because I think comments are usually just a cynical way to get more page-views — I’d use something like <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>.

There would be few resources to load per page. CSS would be preferred to images.

I believe that people way underestimate the value of fast-loading pages. You never want someone to hesitate before following a link to your site because they remember that it’s slow. You don’t want people to give up before getting the chance to read the article. You don’t want to <a href="http://inessential.com/2011/03/16/a_plea_for_baked_weblogs">go dark</a> the minute the site gets linked-to from a more-popular site.

#### Make URLs human-readable

Humane URLs — nothing like ?articleID=2348724&what-||the_heck||is&m=THIS

#### Use responsive design techniques

No separate mobile version; no separate tablet version.

#### Allow a single analytics system

I’d just call it *stats*, though.

Ideally stats would be completely unobtrusive — a system that reads the log every night and generates a report. Or it might be slightly obtrusive, like <a href="http://haveamint.com/">Mint</a>, but no more than that.

#### Keep ads minimal

And no *moving* ads, or ads that appear above other things, or ads that need to be clicked to be closed, would be allowed. <em>No interstitials</em>. (It’s a sign of industry sickness that I even know the word <em>interstitial</em>.)

I’d want to use good networks like <a href="http://decknetwork.net/">The Deck</a>.

#### Allow no Flash anywhere

It might include video from time to time, but I think most people who like to read find video way too slow. And I want readers, not *eyeballs*. (The common use in our industry of the word *eyeballs* is dehumanizing. And idiotic.)

#### Make JavaScript optional and lightweight

The site would work without JavaScript, though it might use JavaScript.

It would not import a bunch of frameworks. The JavaScript would be non-sucky.

No constantly-running JavaScript would be allowed. I’d insist that a page, once-loaded, would use 0.0% of the CPU. No timers and no polling.

#### Never, ever, ever consider SEO

Do things right. I don’t care if the search engines rank it poorly, because I expect links to get passed around via other means.

When has a publication gone underlooked and then was saved by great SEO? Never. Just forget it — it’s beneath you.

#### No custom URL shortener

Sheesh. There’s enough of these things already.

URLs are hints, and they should be <em>good</em> hints. URL shorteners suck meaning out of URLs. They are not good things.

#### Consider a Newsstand app — eventually

Maybe, but not right at first. The priority would be to make a great website that people like to read and that works on phones, tablets, and computers. 

The decision to do a Newsstand app would be based on one thing: could I provide an even better experience than I can via HTML and CSS in a browser? If so, then yes. (I’m a Mac and iOS developer with a long history of writing Newsstand-app-like code. I have a natural bent toward writing the app. But that decision would nevertheless be based only on user experience.)

And if I had an app, the website would never, ever put up an obtrusive prompt guiding you to the App Store.

#### Okay… what would all that get me?

Almost of the above stuff is <em>easy</em>. Most of it is just avoiding stuff that’s stupid, but that lots of publications do. (And that make their jobs harder, for no gain.)

The challenge belongs in one place: the quality of the writing. And that’s it.

If the articles were poorly-written or not interesting or both, the site would fail.

But I believe, though I can’t back it up with numbers, that such a site with good, interesting articles would succeed very well.
