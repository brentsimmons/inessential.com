Don’t listen to Merlin Mann — whether on <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w">Back to Work</a> or <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/">Roderick on the Line</a> — during the day. Don’t listen during your morning commute or at the gym.

It’s an old-fashioned nightclub act. Wait till after the sun goes down, when the sky is dark and the lights are bright.
