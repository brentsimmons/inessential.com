One of the themes — maybe the main theme — of the rebooted Battlestar Galactica was the question: does humanity deserve to survive? Twitter’s trending topics makes me think that the answer is <em>no</em>.

But if I manage not to look into the Twitter abyss — something I’ve gotten very good at — I can usually answer <em>yes</em> to that question.

You might generalize. You might say that <em>any</em> list of popular things is bound to depress you, vex your vigor, jinx your <em>joie de vivre</em>. But I’ve found, to my surprise, that there’s one that’s pretty good: <a href="https://pinboard.in/popular/">Pinboard popular bookmarks</a>.

(It even has an <a href="http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/popular/">RSS feed</a>.)

It has lots of fine things to read. When I go there, I like people.
