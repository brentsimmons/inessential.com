I just bought <a href="http://www.panic.com/blog/2011/04/introducing-prompt-ssh-for-ios/">Prompt by Panic</a>. I was inspired by that <a href="http://yieldthought.com/post/12239282034/swapped-my-macbook-for-an-ipad">guy who replaced his Macbook with an iPad</a>. It occurred to me that I could ssh into my dev machine from anywhere in the house and write code using vim. And I’m just weird enough to *want* to do that. (By “anywhere in the house” I really mean “three feet away on my other desk.”)

Prompt is cool. Simple, good.

I also got my friend (and fellow resident of sunny, lovely Ballard) Hal Mueller’s app <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/historypointer/id463895470?mt=8">HistoryPointer</a>. (App store link.) (It’s a universal iPhone and iPad app.) It detects where you are and shows you, on a map, historical locations nearby. It uses the National Register of Historic Places. Totally handy. I love apps that reveal the coolness of the world around you.
