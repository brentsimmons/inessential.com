Imagine starting your computer programming career way back in the ’70s, in those Watergate-hazy, Archie-bunker-ish days between A Space Odyssey and Star Wars.

Then imagine — in those dark ages, just 10 years after the era that Mad Men depicts — you’re a <em>woman</em>.

Borders are broken up and walls are cracked open person by person, achievement by achievement. My <a href="http://adventuresinnewfield.blogspot.com/">Mom</a> is one of those people who did that.

And she taught me to program — she taught me about code elegance and about how the best programmers are lazy and never want to write the same thing twice. Software architecture was dinner-table talk when I was a boy.

Her heart valve replacement surgery — relatively minor, as heart surgeries go, but still, <em>sheesh</em> — went very well today.

Change comes when a bunch of people say, “Hey, I want to do <em>x</em>. And it doesn’t matter that I’m a <em>y</em> — they can’t stop me!”

I’ve never had to say that, but my Mom — like millions of Americans and people around the world, yesterday and today — did say that. And kept saying it, and did it.

In a day or so she’ll get out of ICU and get her iPhone back and she’ll read my weblog.

Cheers, Mom. You’re my hero. I wish for everybody to have a hero like you.
