When I see a kitten, I smile. I can’t help it. I don’t decide to smile, I just smile.

Same thing with hearing about the new book <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/cdirec/ios-recipes">iOS Recipes</a> by Matt Drance and Paul Warren. I didn’t decide to buy it, I just bought it. Couldn’t help it.
