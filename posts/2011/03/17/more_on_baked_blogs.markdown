I’ve had people point me to some things I know about and some I don’t. Links:

<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a><br />
<a href="http://staceyapp.com/">Stacey</a><br />
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/laguna-blog/">Laguna</a><br />

A few people pointed out the problem with dynamic-authoring/static-publishing — the system spends too much time rebuilding after comments. I was going to mention <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> and similar in my original piece, but didn’t want to over-complicate things. (Didn’t I read that Facebook rolled out a comments systems for weblogs? Sounds likely.)

<a href="http://shapeof.com/archives/2011/03/inessential:_a_plea_for_baked_weblogs.html">Gus Mueller bakes his blog</a> — it’s done in <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/">VoodooPad</a>.

<a href="http://www.markbernstein.org/">Mark Bernstein’s blog</a> has been baked since 2002 — it uses <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a>.
