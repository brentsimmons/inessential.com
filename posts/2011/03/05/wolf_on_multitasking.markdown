<a href="http://rentzsch.tumblr.com/post/3654142811">rentzsch.tumblr.com</a>: “Software is streamlined by defining and supporting predetermined workflows. The tradeoff is that <em>flexibility</em> and <em>composablity</em> suffers.”

Wolf’s last line (which I didn’t quote) is spot on, I think. It describes exactly what we’re all doing, or should be doing.
