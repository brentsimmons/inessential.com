I love how Mike Rundle brings design and code together.

Check out <a href="http://designthencode.com/">Design Then Code</a>. There’s a free tutorial on <a href="http://designthencode.com/scratch/">Building iOS Apps From Scratch</a>.

Further down the page is two linked tutorials taking you through a single project. I’m going to get the Design Rookie tutorial.

Mike has a bunch of great posts on his weblog. A few of my favorites:
