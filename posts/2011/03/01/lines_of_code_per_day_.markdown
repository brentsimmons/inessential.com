I love <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/145991/how-many-lines-of-debugged-code-do-you-produce-in-a-days-work">this question on Stack Overflow</a> — it’s a few years old, but still interesting: “How many lines of debugged code do you produce in a day’s work?”

The answer for me, like many of the respondents, is that the good days are measured in negative numbers. And the great days are measured in very big negative numbers.
