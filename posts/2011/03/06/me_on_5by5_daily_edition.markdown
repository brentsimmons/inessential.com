I’ll be on the <a href="http://5by5.tv/dailyedition">Daily Edition</a> tomorrow morning.

Totally looking forward to it — I’m a huge fan of <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5by5.tv</a>. <a href="http://hivelogic.com/">Dan</a>’s doing such great work.

I want to say that 5by5 is the network of record for our industry in the way that the New York Times used to be the newspaper of record. I’m not sure that actually makes sense — but I want to say it anyway.
