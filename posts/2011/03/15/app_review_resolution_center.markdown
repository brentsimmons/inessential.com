The App Store review process <a href="http://developer.apple.com/news/#resolutioncenter">now has a resolution center</a>. Apple writes, “The Resolution Center offers additional details, explanatory screenshots if applicable, and links to information on how to resolve any issues.”

I haven’t seen it yet, but it sounds like a good thing. Whenever this process can be streamlined — made easier and quicker for Apple and for developers — that ends up a good thing for users. (Better software, delivered more quickly.)
