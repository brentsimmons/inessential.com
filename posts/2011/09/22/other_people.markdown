For years I wrote software with the <em>absolute certain knowledge</em> that nobody would ever see my code. I was a solo developer. Who besides me would ever see the code?

That certain knowledge turned out to be completely wrong, as I discovered when we sold MarsEdit to Daniel Jalkut back in <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/282/red-sweater-acquires-marsedit">2007</a>.

But still, even with that, I was dead sure that nobody would ever see the NetNewsWire code. But even that turned out to be wrong, once we sold it to <a href="http://blackpixel.com/blog/1145/black-pixel-acquires-netnewswire/">Black Pixel</a>. And we also sold TapLynx to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/02/push-io-buys-mobile-app-framework-taplynx-from-newsgator/">push.io</a>.

In other words, <em>all</em> of my code (except for my current app) has ended up in other people’s hands.

Like (hopefully) every developer, I work hard to get better every day. (For good developers, I think there’s a kind-of Moore’s Law: your code quality doubles every 18 months. Not that I would know how to measure that, but it feels about right.)

But now I write code with the <em>absolute certain knowledge</em> that it will end up in somebody else’s hands. I could be wrong, yes, but I’ve learned that it helps me write better and more-maintainable code if I just assume from the start that somebody else, most likely a friend, will end up working on that code base.

In theory, I shouldn’t have to think that way: I should do the same good job no matter what. But I don’t care about theory: if it helps me to think that way, if it helps remind me to go the extra mile to make it good, then it’s a useful way to think.

You’ve heard it before, that future-you is also a different person. While that’s true, it doesn’t have the emotional weight of an <em>actual different person</em> working on your code.

So the lesson I’ve learned is this: that other person is out there, and there’s a good chance I already know him or her. I want that person to be happy when they go to work on my code. I want them to <em>not</em> curse my name and the horse I rode in on.
