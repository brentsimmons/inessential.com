Tim Bray’s <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2011/06/10/NetNewsWire-Lite">counting on Black Pixel</a>. Me, I’ve got no doubt. I just wish there was a magic wand and they’d have new versions already. Now I know what it’s like to be an impatient NetNewsWire user!

But I know that software takes time, so I’ll wait.

(And I’ll remember that the things I wasn’t able to do, or that I wasn’t able to do well, were matters of not enough time. Lack of time is the ugly toad.)
