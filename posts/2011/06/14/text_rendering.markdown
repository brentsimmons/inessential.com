The only bad thing I can say about the iPhone retina display is how it spoils text rendering everywhere else. Text on my iPad and Macs is blurry in comparison.

Given that text rendering on Macs isn’t as sharp as retina displays, it strikes me as borderline sadism when I use an app that doesn’t use subpixel anti-aliasing.
