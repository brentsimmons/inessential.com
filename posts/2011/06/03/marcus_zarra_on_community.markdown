<a href="http://www.cimgf.com/2011/06/03/why-so-serious/">Cocoa Is My Girlfriend</a>: “Sadly though, it is the older, established, members of the community that are turning so hostile. Gone is the sharing and the live/let live attitude that once made this community so great.”

My first thought on reading this was to wonder, have I recently been less-than-excellent toward any of my fellow developers? I can’t think of anything off-hand, but it’s possible. I can be a jerk, or dumb, or just oblivious, like anyone else.

The people who should know better, the older, established members (like me), are responsible for the community, and we get the community we create. What I’ve always liked about this community is that it recognizes that developers are people and not products.

Each person has a consciousness and each person has feelings. Don’t forget that. It’s not nothing.
