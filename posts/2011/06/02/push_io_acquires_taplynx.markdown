<a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/6/prweb8496388.htm">Push IO is the perfect home for TapLynx</a>. I’m so pleased.

Congratulations to Joe Pezzillo and Dan Burcaw and team!

I have no doubt they’ll make me proud, as Daniel has done with <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>. And I can’t wait to see what they do.
