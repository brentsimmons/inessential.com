In other years I’ve posted a list of WWDC tips — which I do mostly as a chance to tease <a href="http://twitter.com/eridius">Kevin Ballard</a>. (I don’t know why I do that, except that I think Kevin’s awesome and I like teasing him, knowing that I’ll see him soon.) I’m letting Kevin off the hook this year.

Instead I’ll quote my co-worker <a href="http://nickharris.wordpress.com/">Nick Harris</a> from an internal communication, giving advice to another co-worker who’ll be attending his first WWDC. Nick’s words:

“Remember every handshake.”

That’s it. Any other good advice is just the above re-stated a bunch of different ways. (Or padded with Kevin-Ballard-teasing, which is fun but not, strictly speaking, useful.)
