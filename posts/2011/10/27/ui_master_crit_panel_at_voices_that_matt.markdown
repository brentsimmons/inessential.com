Some call them contestants, though they don’t win anything. I call them <em>victims</em> — but don’t tell anybody. That’s just between you and me.

They are the brave developers who will volunteer to have their app critiqued by a panel of <strike>blood-sucking vampire geeks</strike> UI experts in a <a href="http://ios2011.voicesthatmatter.com/talks/20555">session at Voices That Matter</a> in Boston this November.

You should volunteer for the <strike>slaughter</strike> constructive criticism. There’s that one UI thing in your app that you struggle with — you know what it is. Bring it.

P.S. Use priority code BSTSPR7 if you haven’t already registered — it <a href="http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/ios2011/register.aspx">saves you $150</a>. (The code is case-sensitive.)
