When I was naming <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>, I wanted a name that was cool, that fit with <a href="http://netnewswireapp.com/">NetNewsWire</a> (which had an earth plus satellite icon at the time), and that suggested editing-at-a-distance — since MarsEdit didn’t edit local documents but blog posts, which are normally stored on a remote server.

I was thinking about names I thought were awesome, and remembered one of my favorite place names: the Free Mars café in Belltown. It occurred to me that “Mars” was perfect, because Mars is cool, it fits with NetNewsWire’s space theme, and Mars is at a distance.

I couldn’t call the app “Free Mars,” not just because it had been used but because it would have suggested the app was free. People would get confused — so instead I added the “Edit” part at the end to make MarsEdit. (Adding “Edit” at the end was an homage to the awesome <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a>.)

Free Mars didn’t exist as Free Mars by the time MarsEdit came along, though it lived on, in a location around the corner, as the Cyclops. And it still lives on, and that’s where <a href="http://seattlexcoders.org/">Seattle Xcoders</a> go to eat and drink and talk twice a month.

I found an <a href="http://www.madametalbot.com/13/bg/freemars/freemars1.htm">image gallery for Free Mars</a>. Very late ’80s, very awesome. I loved that place. (I ate a lot of hummus there, and they served me beer when I was underage, thereby ensuring I would be a regular customer.)

And of course here’s the website for <a href="http://www.cyclopsseattle.com/">Cyclops</a>.

P.S. I was also considering breaking out NetNewsWire 1.0’s outliner into a separate app called MoonLiner. Icon would have had the moon plus a passenger rocket — something like a 747 mixed with a spaceship. But <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnioutliner/">OmniOutliner</a> was so good that I didn’t bother doing MoonLiner. (Though I loved the name.)
