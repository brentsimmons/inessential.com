<a href="http://www.adoptioncurve.net/archives/2011/11/sliding-clocks-around-the-screen-a-la-path.php">Tim Duckett</a> checked out Path: “I was quite intrigued by the little touches, particularly the little clock icon that slides up and down the right-hand side of the screen as you scroll down the timeline. It looks really neat, and it got me wondering how it was done.”

Tim then explains how it was done.
