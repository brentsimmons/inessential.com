Daniel Berlinger: <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2011/12/21/it-wasnt-meant-to-be/">It wasn’t meant to Be</a>.

We all <i>knew</i> it would be Be. We the loyalists saw a path out of the frozen beleaguered tundra, and it was cool.

And then it wasn’t Be, and it wasn’t cool. It was NeXT. Expensive failing enterprise bullshit run by a has-been. Whatever. Totally crushing.

(Our minds — at least mine — turned around quickly though. Well before OS X 10.0 was released.)
