I don’t understand <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/republicans-being-taught-talk-occupy-wall-street-133707949.html">Frank Luntz</a>. He’s clearly gifted. He’s excellent with words.

And yet those gifts don’t come with love or even respect for language — instead, language is debased, used as a tool for power and nothing else. That is the *opposite* of what language is supposed to be.

How is it that some people take Orwell’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak">warning about Newspeak</a> as a blueprint? It’s not a rhetorical question. I don’t know how.
