Pat Dryburgh made an <a href="http://patdryburgh.com/link/ballard-netnewswire-style-sheet/">updated version of my Ballard stylesheet</a> that makes it so images don’t extend beyond the content column. Good thinking.

(It’s not a problem I run into, since I almost always run NetNewsWire on a large display. But if you’re using a laptop, this is a great idea.)

I totally don’t mind Pat’s taking my stylesheet and updating it. I think it’s awesome. But if a situation like this comes up again, it might be a good idea to use a different name and just credit the original. (But I don’t mind. Other stylesheet developers might mind about their own styles, of course.)
