Note to publications and bloggers everywhere — <em>please</em> don’t write 2011 retrospectives or 2012 predictions.

Retrospectives are just re-runs. Clips shows. Totally boring. I was there. I remember. It all happened just this year.

And predictions are useless and boring. Here’s one: “Each day will be pretty much like the day preceding it, with a few notable exceptions. We won’t know what those will be until they happen.”
