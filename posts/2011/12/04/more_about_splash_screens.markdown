Here’s what I found, that freaked me out, when discussing iPhone apps with web publications.

Yes, they always wanted a splash screen instead of the standard screenshot of the interface. That’s not great, but I understood, and we made it possible in TapLynx.

But that’s not all they wanted — they wanted an animated splash screen, and they’d tell me which apps they’d seen that have that.

Here’s the thing: there’s no way to do an animated splash screen unless you delay the appearance of the app UI. While the app is being launched, the system displays a PNG file provided with the app. It can’t be animated.

But you *can* animate once the app is actually loaded. What people asked for is that we *then* display an animated splash screen, and delay the appearance of the user interface.

I didn’t do it.

(To be fair, I would have done it for ONE MILLION DOLLARS. Oh, totally. But publications don’t have that kind of money.)
