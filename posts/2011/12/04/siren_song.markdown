I like this article. It’s important to try things and be curious and give tools a fair shake — and then it’s even more important to be self-aware enough to know which tools fit you and which don’t.

And no tool-user should insist that other people use the same tools. Tools are just tools. What’s way more interesting is what you make with them.
