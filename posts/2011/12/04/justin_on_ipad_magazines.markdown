>Remember, kids. The first rule of mobile development is that <em>no one gives a fuck about your brand</em>. A splash screen with a giant logo is something that makes editors and marketing directors feel good, but to a user it just feels like a meaningless delay.

While working with our TapLynx partners, I learned that splash screens were at the top of most everyone’s wish-list. Animated splash screens especially. They’d point to other apps that had them and ask why couldn’t they have them too.

I’d explain how and why those apps were doing a disservice to their users. But it didn’t matter. Splash screens are chocolate plus crack plus sex plus a big juicy steak to marketers.
