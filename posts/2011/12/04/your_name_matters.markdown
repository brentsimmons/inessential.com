Take a look at your weblog. How easy is it to find your name?

It’s *hard* in a surprising number of weblogs. But I’m not going to link to your weblog unless I can find your name.

I don’t think it’s deliberate, most of the time — I think it’s just a case that people forget to think of it. After all, the author knows whose weblog it is.
