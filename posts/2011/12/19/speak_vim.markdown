<a href="http://yanpritzker.com/2011/12/16/learn-to-speak-vim-verbs-nouns-and-modifiers/">Yan Pritzker</a>: “To move efficiently in vim, don’t try to do anything by pressing keys many times, instead speak to the editor in sentences.”

It’s a key concept in Vim. It’s what makes it powerful.

It’s also what makes Vim seem like a game, where you keep getting little bursts of enlightenment and move to the next level.
