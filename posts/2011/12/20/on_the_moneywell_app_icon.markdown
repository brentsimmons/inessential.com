>I built the bucket by using a cloner to arrange copies of a tapered rectangle in a circle. The taller planks are an extrusion of a curved spline, angled to to match the arrangement of the other planks. The handle is a sweep NURBS, while the metal bands and coins are lathes. Really, the modeling is very simple.

I love that *simple* part. Simple if you’ve spent hundreds (or thousands) of hours in Cinema 4D, I suspect. Me, I don’t even know what a NURBS is.

Great article. I love reading about how designers work, as I’m (slowly) learning on my own.
