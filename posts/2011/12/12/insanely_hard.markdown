<a href="http://www.georgesaines.com/?p=513">George Saines</a> writes about how hard it is to make a “kick-ass iPhone app.”

>The app market is cruel, even moreso for the need to do a Hollywood launch. Because nobody has solved the discoverability problem in the app store, you need to launch big and magically figure out exactly what users want ahead of time.
