I’ve discovered there may have been some misunderstanding of my recent posts on websites and reading: <a href="http://inessential.com/2011/11/22/the_pummeling_pages">The Pummeling Pages</a>, <a href="http://inessential.com/2011/11/23/pub_rules">Pub Rules</a>, and <a href="http://inessential.com/2011/11/25/the_readable_future">The Readable Future</a>.

I meant to make it clear that I was writing to the people who make websites.

I was *not* advocating smartphone apps or Newsstand apps as a way for them to fix their problems. My entire purpose was to advocate for really great websites that I love visiting in my browser.

In fact, I’ll propose three rules for prospective Newsstand app authors:

1. You’re not allowed to write a Newsstand app until your website rocks.

2. You’re not allowed to require someone to use the Newsstand app version of your site when they’re on a phone or iPad.

3. You’re not allowed to use obtrusive (article-obscuring) ads on your own site for your Newsstand app version.

If you still want to write a Newsstand app, after the above, then cool — do it. Make sure it’s as awesome as your website but also *has a clear reason for existing*.

(Hopefully it’s clear that I’m using Newsstand both specifically and as shorthand for all native apps, designed to replace your website, that run on smartphones and tablets.)
