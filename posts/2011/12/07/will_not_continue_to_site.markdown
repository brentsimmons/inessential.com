I was about to link to an article on Forbes.com that I had seen on my iPhone. But when I went there on my Mac I got one of those full-page ads with a countdown and a “Continue to Site” link.

I didn’t click “Continue to Site,” and I decided not to link to the article.

This is one of the things that gets me about analytics. You can measure how many people don’t click “Continue to Site,” or who don’t wait for the ad to finish. But you can’t measure how many people would have then blogged or tweeted or shared that article but then didn’t.
