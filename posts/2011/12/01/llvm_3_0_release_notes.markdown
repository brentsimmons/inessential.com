<a href="http://memerial.net/1157-so-much-cocaine"><em>So much</em></a> good stuff.

I can’t help but wonder — if you combine these great tools with the <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/discuss-gnustep/2011-11/msg00113.html">GNUStep Objective-C Runtime 1.6 release</a>, will we start seeing Objective-C support on platforms other than Apple’s?

If you’re a phone or tablet platform vendor, it might not be a bad idea, since it might make it easier to attract developers.

But, then again, I have no idea what happened behind the scenes when <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/story/10/11/25/0432204/sony-adopts-objective-c-and-gnustep-frameworks">Sony announced just such an intention</a> and then withdrew it.
