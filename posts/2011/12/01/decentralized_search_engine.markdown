I downloaded <a href="http://yacy.net/en/">YaCy</a> for Macintosh. It’s massively geeky right now — but I love the idea.

Decentralization, in tech as in politics, is how we prevent one entity from having too much power. Power corrupts.

You could say that YaCy in its current form would never displace any of the current popular search engines. You’d be right — but that’s not an argument against trying to create a decentralized search engine. That’s just saying that early efforts are for techies. Which is as it should be.
