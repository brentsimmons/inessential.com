I don’t even use Git — but <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gitbox/id403388357">Gitbox is on sale for $10</a> instead of $40 because it’s its birthday. And the app is <a href="http://shapeof.com/archives/2011/12/gitbox_is_1_year_old.html">Gus’s favorite Git client</a>. So I bought it.

The Mac App Store makes it so easy.
