<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/12/13/about2012ForNieman.html">Dave Winer</a>: “At the end of this year I’m thinking about the need for proper criticism of software, alongside other arts like theater, movies, music, books, travel, food and architecture. It’s finally time to stop being all gee whiz about this stuff.”
