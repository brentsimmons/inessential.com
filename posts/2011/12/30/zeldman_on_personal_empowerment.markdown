Jeffrey Zeldman, <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2011/12/30/the-maker-makes-on-design-community-and-personal-empowerment/">The maker makes: on design, community, and personal empowerment</a>:

>The year was 1995, and I was tinkering at my first website. The medium was raw and ugly, like a forceps baby; yet even in its blind, howling state, it made me a writer, a designer, and a publisher — ambitions which had eluded me during more than a decade of underachieving desert wanderings.

I’d be surprised if there are many readers who don’t recognize themselves in what Zeldman writes. Why I’m here and why you’re here hasn’t changed in the years since.
