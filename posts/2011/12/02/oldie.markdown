Not much going on today. Because it’s Friday, I guess.

So here’s an oldie from 2001 about <a href="http://inessential.com/2001/06/07/2001_06_07">teaching a squirrel to play baseball</a>. It’s still my favorite post on this blog.

(Part of me wants to edit it to fix grammar and rhythm, but I resist. It even has <a href="http://inessential.com/2011/11/29/shock_the_monocle">comma splices</a> OMG.)
