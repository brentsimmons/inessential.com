It’s their app, of course, but I don’t mind saying that we helped build it. And that I’m proud of it.

As Kara alluded to her in her post, part of the fun was watching it roll out to different App Stores last night. We found it first in Latvia.

It reminds me of the old joke from college days — every indie band claimed to be <em>big in Europe</em>. Always. (And there was no web, so we couldn’t actually check.) So I wanted “We’re Big in Europe” T-shirts printed up. But it appeared in the US App Store before long, and the joke would have been lost on everybody who wasn't me, anyway. :)

Here’s the iTunes <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=316429710&mt=8&s=143441">App Store</a> link. (The app is free.)
