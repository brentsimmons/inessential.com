But as a reader, the super-abundance is driving me a bit nuts.”

I probably shouldn’t agree — but I do.

I probably shouldn’t tell you to unsubscribe from some of your feeds. But you should.

Look: <em>you’re going to get the news</em>.

A bunch comes in through your news reader. But you also get news from people via email, IM, irc, Twitter, Facebook, and whatever else.

If it’s cool or interesting, you won’t miss it. Even with fewer feeds.

(I’m down to 74 myself.)
