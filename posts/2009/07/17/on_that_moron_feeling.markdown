Five <em>months</em> ago, even.

I’ve heard this from other programmers, so I don’t think I’m alone. They look back at old code they wrote and say, “What <em>idiot</em> wrote this <em>crap</em>?”

I used to wonder if this feeling would ever go away — as if I’d just get to the point where I’m super-awesome and that’s it.

But over the years I’ve learned to <em>rely</em> on this feeling. Were it ever to go away, then I’d be worried like hell. It would mean I’m not learning and not improving.

So, yes, I’m <em>proud</em> to have been such a moron so recently.
