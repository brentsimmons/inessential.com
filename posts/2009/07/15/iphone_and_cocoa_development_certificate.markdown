The <a href="http://www.extension.washington.edu/ext/certificates/iph/iph_gen.asp">University of Washington Extension</a> has added a Mac and iPhone program.

A bunch of smart and accomplished local developers (plus me) are on the <a href="http://www.extension.washington.edu/ext/certificates/iph/iph_brd.asp">advisory board</a>.

If you live in or near Seattle, and you want to learn Cocoa programming â€” you should sign up <a href="http://www.extension.washington.edu/ext/certificates/iph/iph_hta.asp">here</a>.
