The cable news channels are obsessed with Twitter these days. And of course they read feedback from Facebook and email too.

I wish they wouldn’t. I <em>hate</em> it. It wastes my time.

This on-air stuff proves that people have strong opinions that they can express succinctly — and that contribute nothing to the dialog or understanding of an issue. Nothing new there.

And it shows how desperate the news channels are to appear young, or plugged-in, or open, or whatever. I’d rather they did a better job of <em>news reporting</em>.
