In a nutshell: the price of the for-pay, ad-free versions of NetNewsWire for Macintosh and for iPhone will go up at midnight tonight. If you were thinking of buying, please don’t miss out. (Last day to save $5 on the Mac version and save $3 on the iPhone version.)

See the <a href="http://ranchero.com/2009/10/31/sale_ends_today_for_netnewswire_for_mac_">sale ends today</a> post on ranchero.com for more detail.

Use the money you save to buy other cool iPhone apps! A few I recommend are <a href="http://pickintimeapp.com/">Pickin’ Time</a>, <a href="http://postage.roguesheep.com/">Postage</a>, and <a href="http://wordspin.roguesheep.com/">Word Spin</a>.
