In <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> there are two weblogs I post to most often, and I don’t like pulling down the menu item via my mouse to choose the weblog. So, instead, I assigned them keyboard shortcuts: ctrl-1 for ranchero and ctrl-2 for inessential.

Saves a little time, makes me happy.

#### How I did it

I opened System Preferences, then clicked Keyboard & Mouse. Then clicked the Keyboard Shortcuts tab.

I clicked the + button, then chose MarsEdit from the list of apps. I entered ranchero for Menu Title, and gave it ctrl-1 for the Keyboard Shortcut. Then repeated that for inessential, but with ctrl-2 as the shortcut.

I didn’t even have to re-launch MarsEdit to make it work — though, if it doesn’t work for you, you might first try re-launching MarsEdit.

#### Notes

This was inspired by a <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/137144/mailsend.html">similar tip for Mail</a> — I use the same technique for choosing my From email account. (Since I have three email addresses.)

The cool curved-shadow in the screenshot above is done in <a href="http://www.flyingmeat.com/blog/archives/2009/01/curved_drop_shadows_in_acorn.html">Acorn via a script Gus made</a>. Gus had first seen the effect in <a href="http://blog.cocoia.com/2009/01/07/iwork-ilife-09-ui-roundup/">Cocoia's iLife ’09 UI Roundup</a>, which is worth reading, if you haven’t already.
