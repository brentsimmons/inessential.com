<a href="http://site.ringce.com/products/hyde/hyde.html">Hyde</a> is a static website generator written in Python. It uses Django templates. Could be cool. (Love the tag line: “we wants it. we needs it.”)

Hyde is based on <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master">Jekyll</a>, naturally. Here’s the <a href="http://site.ringce.com/blog/2009/introducing_hyde.html">story of Hyde</a>.

Also see <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/Yaki">Yaki</a>, the Python-based system that runs Tao of Mac.

I love finding that the world of static website generators is way more alive than I’d realized.
