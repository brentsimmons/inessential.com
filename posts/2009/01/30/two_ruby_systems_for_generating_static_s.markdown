I learned about a couple shipping systems for generating static sites via Ruby.

<a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">nanoc</a> “is a tool that runs on your local computer and compiles Markdown, Textile, Haml, etc. documents into static web pages, ready for uploading to any web host.” Looks modern, cool, Ruby-ish.

<a href="http://www.apeth.com/RubyFrontierDocs/">RubyFrontier</a> is much more like Frontier’s website framework than my system is — the details are deliberately much closer. I shouldn’t be surprised at all to find that the inestimable Matt Neuburg has walked this path before me.
