@title NetNewsWire 6.2: RSS Plus Markdown
@pubDate 2025-11-05 13:24:30 -0800

On the NetNewsWire blog I’ve just announced NetNewsWire 6.2 for Mac and iOS.

This release is almost entirely bug fixes — but it does add a couple small features and one potentially interesting one: it now supports Markdown in RSS (via the `source:markdown` element). [Read all about it](https://netnewswire.blog/2025/11/05/netnewswire-for-mac-and-ios.html) on the NetNewsWire blog.

(And now we’re working on NetNewsWire 7, which [will adopt the new Liquid Glass UI](https://netnewswire.blog/2025/10/07/the-liquid-glass-plan.html).)
