@title Retirement and NetNewsWire

To answer some questions people have asked me about my impending retirement…

#### What does it mean for NetNewsWire?

Good things! I’m not retiring from writing apps — which means I’ll have a lot more time for working on NetNewsWire.

It’s been 15 years since the last time I could work on NetNewsWire during weekdays (as opposed to just nights and weekends), and I’m super-psyched for this.

#### Will you work on any other apps?

Yes. I have several ideas for other apps I’d like to work on, and have made a little progress on one of them.

They will all be free and open source. I have no plans to create apps for money. (I’ll be retired — *not working for money anymore* is the point.)

#### Will you be taking a big trip right after retiring?

Every time this comes up, I joke that the first thing I’ll be doing is *sleeping*. Forty years of work is a long time, and I’ve earned a long nap.

We do have some travel plans, but no big trips yet. We will. There’s so much of the world we want to see!

My actual first week of retirement will be taken up by WWDC. I won’t be there — I’ll be at home watching the videos like most everyone else. Only this time I won’t have to think about how the changes will affect things at work.

#### Do you have any other hobbies or plans? Are you getting into woodworking? Pizza-making?

Yes to other hobbies and plans, though probably not woodworking or pizza (but never say never — those are pretty tempting ideas!).

Making apps is important to me — contributing to the public stack is how I can best use my abilities to make the world better — but it’s also not the only thing.

I have more ideas than time, which is a good problem to have, and once I have some space to think and feel I’ll be able to start picking and get to work.

#### Will you be blogging more?

I hope so!

The hard part is, after 25 years, finding things to say that I haven’t already said. Maybe I’ll just decide it’s okay to repeat myself in new ways. 🐥
