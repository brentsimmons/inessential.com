I wrote in my [love letter to my colleagues at Audible](https://inessential.com/2025/05/23/love_letter.html) that retirement is coming up â€”Â and now itâ€™s here. Todayâ€™s the day!

Iâ€™ve attended my last meetings. Iâ€™ve said my goodbyes. My laptopâ€™s ready to ship back to Audible HQ.

I started working in 1984, while in high school, busing tables part time at [Schaefers Canal House](https://www.schaeferscanalhouse.com/) in Chesapeake City, MD.

And I stopped working this day in 2025, almost 41 years later, as a senior engineer (which is surprisingly a lot like busing tables â€”Â lots of cleanup and setting the table just right for the customers to have a great time).

Along the way I worked on, among other apps, Userland Frontier, NetNewsWire, MarsEdit, Glassboard, Vesper, OmniFocus, OmniOutliner, and Audible.

My immediate plan â€”Â Exhale! Breathe. Enjoy a steak. Watch WWDC from the comfort of home next week. Get back to work on NetNewsWire.
