James Dempsey and the Breakpoints will be appearing in a [Breakpoints Jam this Thursday](https://xcoders.org/2025/08/12/special-event-breakpoint-jam-with.html) (Aug. 21) at Bale Breaker in Ballard. Free show! Awesome songs!

The event starts at 6 pm and music will start around 7 pm. I’ll be on guitar — and you can expect local superstars Ken Case (keyboard, vocals) and Laura Savino (vocals) plus a special mystery guest or two from out of town.

The show will be mostly acoustic, and it will be outside at the picnic tables. I hope to see you there!
