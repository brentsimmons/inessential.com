The Nordic Museum in my neighborhood is now [officially the National Nordic Museum](https://www.myballard.com/2019/03/15/nordic-museum-now-known-as-national-nordic-museum/). Very cool!

We also have a statue of Leif Erickson. And we hold a parade for [Sytennde Mai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Constitution_Day) every year.
