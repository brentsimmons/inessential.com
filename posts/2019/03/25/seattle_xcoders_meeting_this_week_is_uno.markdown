Seattle Xcoders meeting this week is unofficial — no actual meeting. Just show up at the Cyclops (in the back, in the restaurant section) for food and/or drinks and conversation. Thursday (March 28) at 6:30 pm.

Lots of Apple news this week! But of course we talk about whatever. We *could* talk about Apple stuff if you want to. :)
