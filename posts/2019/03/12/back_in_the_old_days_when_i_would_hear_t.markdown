Back in the old days, when I would hear that someone was writing an RSS reader, I’d worry that it was more competition.

These days when I hear that same news, I get excited. Sure, I want lots of people to use NetNewsWire — but, *way* more than that, I want lots of people to use RSS readers.

The more the better, since no one app is going to be the right thing for everybody.

And here’s [Rob Fahrni working on a river-of-news type RSS reader](https://fahrni.micro.blog/2019/03/12/it-looks-like.html) for Mac and iOS. Cool!

Writing an open source app, and not having to think about making money with it, is utterly thrilling. I love this.

Among other things, it means I get to be a cheerleader for other people’s work, which is totally fun for me. Makes me happy.
