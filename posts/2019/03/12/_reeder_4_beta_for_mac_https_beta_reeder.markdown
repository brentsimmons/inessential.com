[Reeder 4 beta for Mac](https://beta.reeder.ch/) is up!

I had been on the verge of writing about this. I’d noticed some people saying things to the effect of, “Oh, he must have stopped working on it. He’s been so quiet.”

This is one of those things that drives me *nuts*. When a developer says they’re working on something, and then they’re quiet, it’s *because they’re busy working on it*.
