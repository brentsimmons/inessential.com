The system I wrote about [yesterday](http://inessential.com/2019/03/05/implementing_single_key_shortcuts_in_net) for specifying key bindings in NetNewsWire is just a small version of the system built into the <a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/site/cocoa-text.html">Cocoa Text System</a>.

Most Mac users probably donâ€™t know about this. I forget about it for years at a time. But you can actually customize text editing keyboard shortcuts globally by editing a plist.
