[Big story on RSS readers](https://itunes.apple.com/us/story/id1350923731) in the iOS App Store today:

> Really simple syndication — better known as RSS — is an enduringly useful technology that collects online articles from various sources in one convenient place.

The bummer about these articles is that the full thing can only be read in the iOS App Store. It would be nice if they actually appeared on the web, too.

The articles are often very well done and beautifully illustrated — and it would be to the benefit of Apple, and app developers, if these articles were findable and readable by people sitting in front of a computer.
