One thing I’m weirdly proud of is my position as an amateur programmer.

When I point that out, people say, “Well, but…” — and I know where they’re going, that after 25 years of professional experience I’m not what you think of when you think of “amateur.”

And yet, it’s still *true*. It’s just that I’ve come out the other side, and now I get to work on exactly what I want to, the way I want to, without any thoughts of trying to make money at it.

I can take risks! I can work with anybody who shows up! It’s a pure thrill. It’s like writing single-malt apps.

And I would wish for more people to find themselves in this position — eventually, anyway — because I want to see what *they* would make.

PS The Dictionary app on my Mac says of the origin of the word “amateur”:

> late 18th century: from French, from Italian *amatore*, from Latin *amator* ‘lover’, from *amare* ‘to love’.

Spot-on.
