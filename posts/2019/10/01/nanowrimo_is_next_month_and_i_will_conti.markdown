NaNoWriMo is next month, and I will continue my streak of not participating in it. I’m super-impressed by the people who *do*, though.

It would take me a month of hard, solid work all November to decide on an idea to write about, then another month to think it through some more — or two months, really, because the holidays get in the way — and then about a year of nightly work to decide on a plot outline and characters and tone, and then another year of refining that outline, and then, by NaNoWriMo 2021 or 2022, I’d be ready to start writing. I suspect I’d average about 300 words a day, which would get me about 9,000 words for the month — which is well less than a novel or even the 50,000 words goal.

I blog instead.

PS What made me think of this: Cheri Baker, [Let’s Half-Ass NaNoWriMo Together](https://www.cheribaker.com/half-ass-nanowrimo/).
