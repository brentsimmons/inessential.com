The main things in this release are 1) enhanced performance and 2) importing subscriptions from NetNewsWire 3 (since it won‘t run on Catalina).

There are also a bunch of bug fixes — including a fix for the space bar behavior on Catalina — and there’s a new feature: you can type the `s` key to star and unstar an article.
