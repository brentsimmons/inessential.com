Omni’s [hiring a Senior Front-End Web Developer](https://www.omnigroup.com/jobs/) to work on [OmniFocus for the Web](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/web/).

Omni’s a truly great place to work. You’d have your own office — and there’s a decent chance it would be right near mine. (The job is part of the Design department, and marketing is also part of the Design department.)

We also have common areas too, for when you prefer to work around other people. You’re not locked into your office. :)

Benefits are great. The [view of Lake Union and Capitol Hill](https://microblog.omnigroup.com/2019/10/11/we-dont-have.html) is beautiful. The kitchen folks make us wonderful food.

But best of all: it’s great fun to work with these people on these apps.

So — if you’re a web developer, [please apply](https://www.omnigroup.com/jobs/)!

PS You can learn more about OmniFocus for the Web by listening to [How We Built OmniFocus for the Web](https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/episode/how-we-built-omnifocus-for-the-web) (an episode of The Omni Show) and by reading [OmniFocus for the Web: Under the Hood](https://inside.omnifocus.com/blog/omnifocus-for-the-web-under-the-hood).
