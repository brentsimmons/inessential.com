This Thursday, Oct. 10, [Xcoders turns 15 years old](https://xcoders.org/2019/09/11/xcoders-th-anniversary.html)!

We’d be thrilled if you could come to the meeting. Your [Xcoders podcasters](https://xcoders.org/2019/10/05/xcoders-podcast-october.html) will be talking to a panel of old-timers about the history of the group. And afterward we’ll go to the Cyclops and hang out — just like we always do.

I don’t think I need to remind anyone of the important of community. It gives back to us so much more than we as individuals could ever put into it.

And Xcoders is one of the oldest and greatest of the Mac and iOS app-making communities. Any good history of the modern Apple development ecosystem would have a chapter on Xcoders: it’s an institution, and it’s been amazing to watch it grow and evolve over the years.

So I’m asking something of you: please come to this one and help us celebrate!

Come even if you haven’t been in a long time, or even if you have to travel. Even if you go to Redmond or Vancouver Xcoders. Or even if you’ve never been. We’ll be so happy to see you!

PS The Xcoders blog has the [details on time and place](https://xcoders.org/2019/09/11/xcoders-th-anniversary.html).
