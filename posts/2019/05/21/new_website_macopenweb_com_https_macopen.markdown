New website: [macopenweb.com](https://macopenweb.com/) is a single-page directory of “open and indie Mac, iOS, and web apps that help promote the open web.” It’s by my friend [Brian Warren](http://begoodnotbad.com/).

I *love* this. This is a page that would never appear as a category on the App Store — and yet it’s an important category.

And it’s a reminder that we can create things that don’t appear on Twitter, Facebook, or Medium. Putting up a website isn’t hard. And it’s fun! Plus you get to do it exactly how you want to do it.

The site has a [repo on GitHub](https://github.com/good/openweb), where you can file bugs and feature requests or make pull requests.

Do yourself a favor and bookmark the site. :)
