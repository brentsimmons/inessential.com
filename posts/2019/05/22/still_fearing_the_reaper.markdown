Steve Troughton-Smith writes a lovely article [(Don’t Fear) The Reaper](https://www.highcaffeinecontent.com/blog/20190522-(Dont-Fear)-The-Reaper) — but I still fear the reaper. I do.

Steve’s point is that the Mac has been through transitions before. A transition takes time, and we don’t necessarily know exactly how it will end up, but it ends up marvelously.

I completely agree about the past: Mac OS X was a thrilling fusion of the classic Mac experience and NEXTSTEP, with a whole bunch of new stuff added.

I *loved* it.

I started writing NetNewsWire, a Cocoa app, during the 10.1 days, even though I had been a classic Mac developer. I had no interest in Carbon — because Cocoa was an amazing framework, so far ahead of what we had on the Mac before.

With OS X we had the power and ease-of-use of the Mac — including [Apple events](https://inessential.com/2019/04/25/the_under_appreciated_awesomeness_of_app) — *and* we had Unix under the hood and a Terminal app. This brought [so much power and freedom](https://inessential.com/2019/04/23/freedom) to the Mac.

It was incredible. It‘s *still* incredible.

So, knowing how this has worked out in the past, why do I fear the reaper?

*Because bringing UIKit brings no new power.* If anything, it subtracts power. UIKit apps — at least so far — are all sandboxed and available only via the App Store. They don’t offer [everything AppKit offers](https://pilky.me/appreciating-appkit-part-1/).

And, to make things worse, it’s reasonable to be somewhat [skeptical](https://500ish.com/reading-the-room-d344b9a1580f) of Apple leadership’s understanding of the platform. Daring Fireball [quotes a source](https://daringfireball.net/2019/05/good_old_fashioned_macbook_pro_speed_bumps) at Apple as saying they had “taken their eye off the ball on Mac.”

Getting the Mac OS X transition right was a priority for the company: if it failed, the company would fail. But with this? Not the same story at all.

I will be delighted — and relieved, and singing hosannas — when it turns out I was wrong to fear the reaper. I hope so very badly that I’m wasting my time with my worries. I know what Apple is capable of — I just need to *see* it.
