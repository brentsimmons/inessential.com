I used to think that the secret of happiness is that, when you show up at [whatever], people are happy to see you.

Which is great! It truly is. No question. When people see you, and they’re glad, it’s so great. It is.

But years on I figured out the real secret: what’s even better is that when *they* show up, you’re happy to see *them*, and you show it.

That’s the real secret to happiness.

Remember that at WWDC. :)
