[Dave Mark wonders](http://www.loopinsight.com/2019/05/09/why-the-mac-wont-end-up-locked-down-like-ios/) if Marzipan apps will be available only through the App Store.

I wonder this too. This one of the biggest questions for this year’s WWDC. The answer matters to me personally: if Marzipan apps are App-Store-only, then I can’t use it for my apps.
