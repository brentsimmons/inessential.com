[The Xcoders post](https://xcoders.org/2019/05/02/for-our-june.html) has more detail.

This is a great way to get started on learning how to talk in front of an audience. The Xcoders audience is wonderful. And you don’t have to talk long, and it will be on a topic that doesn’t have any experts sitting in the audience.

In other words: nobody’s judging you — we just want to learn what you have to tell us about. :)
