About a year ago, in early 2019, NetNewsWire for Mac was at the “d” (development) level, where it had been for years. For instance, we released [NetNewsWire 5.0d8](https://nnw.ranchero.com/2019/01/27/netnewswire-d.html) on January 27.

We shipped the first alpha — feature complete, free of known bugs, but needing testing — by WWDC. [NetNewsWire 5.0a1](https://nnw.ranchero.com/2019/05/31/netnewswire-a.html) was released May 31.

We [reached beta](https://nnw.ranchero.com/2019/08/12/netnewswire-has-finally.html) in August, and then [shipped NetNewsWire 5.0](https://inessential.com/2019/08/26/netnewswire_5_0_now_available) for Mac on August 26.

We continued to ship updates to the Mac app — [NetNewsWire 5.0.3](https://nnw.ranchero.com/2019/10/22/netnewswire-for-mac.html), the most recent, shipped October 22.

Maurice started working on the iOS app before we shipped 5.0 of the Mac app — and, on Dec. 22, we shipped a [public TestFlight beta of NetNewsWire 5.0 for iOS](https://inessential.com/2019/12/22/netnewswire_5_for_ios_public_testflight).

The upshot: in 2019 we made both apps, Mac and iOS, great foundations for our future work. Getting to this point was no small thing — it took years, after all. But we shipped the Mac app, and we’ve gotten the iOS app to nearly-shipping.

I feel great about our pace! I know it can be frustrating for anybody waiting on some one specific thing — especially if it’s support for the syncing service you use — but, in 2019, the NetNewsWire team *rocked*.

Remember that it’s a group of volunteers who are [doing this for love](https://inessential.com/2015/06/30/love).

P.S. I’ll write another blog post soon-ish on plans for 2020. :)
