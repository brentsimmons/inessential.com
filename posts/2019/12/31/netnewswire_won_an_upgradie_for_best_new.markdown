NetNewsWire won an Upgradie for [Best Newcomer Mac App](https://upgradies.com/year/2019)! The whole team is so happy for this.

Other awesome stuff won too — one of my favorites is [Automators](https://www.relay.fm/automators), which won Favorite Tech Podcast.

[Here’s the episode](https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/278) where Myke Hurley and Jason Snell talk about the winners and runners-up.
