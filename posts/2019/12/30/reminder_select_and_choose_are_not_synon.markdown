From the [Apple Style Guide](https://help.apple.com/applestyleguide/):

> Use <em>choose</em>, not <em>select</em>, for menu items. In general, the user <em>selects</em> something (such as a file or disk icon, an email message, or a section of text) and then <em>chooses</em> a command to act on the selection.

…and…

> Use <em>select</em>, not <em>choose</em>, to refer to the action users perform when they select among multiple objects—such as icons, graphic images, radio buttons, or checkboxes—or when they highlight text for editing.

People often think, mistakenly, that *select* is the polite or proper form of *choose* — but, in user-interface-world, they actually mean different things.
