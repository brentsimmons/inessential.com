I’ve been working on the [NetNewsWire privacy policy](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/privacypolicy), which I realized I needed as I was working on crash log collecting.

If you have questions, feedback, or suggestions, please let me know.

The gist is pretty simple: I really, really, really do not want anybody’s information. It’s not interesting or useful to me, and managing it is a burden I don’t want. Most importantly: I believe strongly in not just a decentralized web but a web where privacy is respected.

That said, I do have webserver logs (which, frankly, I complete ignore — I don’t even look at the stats, though that could change), and I collect crash logs when the user opts in, because making sure that the app doesn’t crash is job one.

My favorite line of the privacy policy:

>Neither ranchero.com nor inessential.com use any cookies or JavaScript, and they do not display any ads.

I wish there were a clever marketing name for no-cookies/no-JavaScript sites. It should be a trend.

While the industry is focused on SSL everywhere, we’re not looking at the other half of surveillance tech.
