One of my favorite parts of the latest [The Important Thing](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-one-about-information-consumption/) podcast is where Rands explains that, in his RSS reader, he just marks-all-as-read at will.

For the kinds of RSS readers that track read/unread status, *this is the right approach*. If something’s truly important, it will come to you another way. And there are so many other ways that important things will reach you than in, say, 2005.

I write an RSS reader and I do this myself. (I often read just what’s new today, and then mark everything older as read.)

It’s totally a-okay. Your RSS reader is not your task master.
