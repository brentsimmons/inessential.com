The best book I’ve ever read on programming and making apps is [Six Memos for the Next Millennium](https://smile.amazon.com/Memos-Next-Millennium-Italo-Calvino/dp/0544146670/) by Italo Calvino.

It’s about literature, not programming. But it applies, and I highly recommend it to people who make apps.
