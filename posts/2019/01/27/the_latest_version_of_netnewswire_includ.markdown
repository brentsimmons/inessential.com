The latest version of NetNewsWire includes a crash log reporter. On each launch, it looks for the latest crash log. If it finds one, and it hasnâ€™t been sent in yet, it prompts the user to send it in.

(The user may choose not to. The user may also choose just to send crash logs automatically in the future.)

At the moment, NetNewsWire has no known crashing bugs. This may change as people update!

I might start getting crash logs. And I might not. Either way is interesting.

PS At the moment I have [12 bugs to go before 5.0a1 ships](https://github.com/brentsimmons/NetNewsWire/milestone/1).
