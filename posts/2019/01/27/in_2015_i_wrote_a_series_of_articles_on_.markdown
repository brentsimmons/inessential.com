In 2015 I wrote a series of articles on [How Not To Crash](http://inessential.com/hownottocrash). My favorite part is at the end of [the last article](http://inessential.com/2015/06/10/how_not_to_crash_9_mindset), the “Cape, mask” section.

It begins:

>When I was younger I wanted to be a code magician — or, really, a hero. But I learned that *actual software quality is more important than what I imagine other people think of me*.
>
>And, more: quality is a reward that’s almost spiritual. It’s an act of devotion, both selfish and unselfish, to something more important than ego.
