I’ve started the next step in my plans for the [Xcoders blog](https://xcoders.org/) — I’m now posting links to:

* News about apps written by Xcoders,
* Interesting blog posts written by Xcoders,
* And news from elsewhere of interest to Xcoders.

In other words, it’s becoming a developer news blog with a Northwest point of view. And I think it will be worth following, even if you don’t attend Xcoders (or don’t even live in the Northwest).

If you’re on Micro.blog, you can [follow Xcoders](https://micro.blog/xcoders). And, of course, most importantly, it has an [RSS feed](https://xcoders.org/feed.xml) and a [JSON Feed](https://xcoders.org/feed.json) so you can subscribe in your RSS reader.
