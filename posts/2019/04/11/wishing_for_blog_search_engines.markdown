One thing I wish we had that we used to have: blog-only search engines.

You could go and search for a hash tag. Or for links to your blog or elsewhere. Or for keywords. Etc.

It should have an API that returns RSS, so RSS reader users could set up persistent, updated searches.

There used to be a *bunch* of these, and now there are none that I know of.

Sure, it’s easy to search on Twitter. But you only get things posted on Twitter, and it doesn’t search the content of *linked-to* articles. So you’ll miss all kinds of things.

I can’t do this work myself — partly because I’m too busy with work and with other apps, and partly because I’m no expert at web-based stuff like this. I wish I could.
