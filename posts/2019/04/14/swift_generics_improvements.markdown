Several days ago Joe Groff posted [Improving the UI of generics](https://forums.swift.org/t/improving-the-ui-of-generics/22814) on the Swift forums.

This proposal felt important — but it was, I hate to admit, really slow going for me to figure it out. For one thing, I had no idea what an “existential” is.

This is no criticism: this stuff, like a scientific paper, has to be written precisely and with agreed-upon terminology. It’s just that I don’t know all the terminology.

So, on another discussion forum, some of my friends were talking about it, and two people really helped with everyone’s understanding of the proposal: [Greg Titus](https://twitter.com/gregtitus) and [Tim Ekl](https://twitter.com/timothyekl).

And then Tim went on to write a blog post which explains all of this in a way that regular Swift users — like me! — can understand.

Go read it! [Swift Generics Evolution](https://www.timekl.com/blog/2019/04/14/swift-generics-evolution/) by Tim Ekl.

I’ve used generics a little, but I didn’t like what it did to the readability of my code. Now that I understand this new proposal, I like it. Very much.
