I wrote up three new tech notes:

[Why Articles and Statuses Are Separate Tables](https://github.com/brentsimmons/NetNewsWire/blob/master/Technotes/ArticlesAndStatuses.markdown)

[Possible Gotchas To Be Aware Of When Working on Syncing](https://github.com/brentsimmons/NetNewsWire/blob/master/Technotes/SyncGotchas.markdown)

[Syncing Implementation Roadmap](https://github.com/brentsimmons/NetNewsWire/blob/master/Technotes/SyncingImplementationRoadmap.markdown)

The last one is the important one — and it shows (but you knew already) that Syncing Is Not a Small Feature.

The good news is that a lot of it is infrastructure that needs to be written just once. Adding systems later will be much easier than adding the first one.

(I might be done with tech notes for now.)
