On the [latest episode of The Omni Show](https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/episode/annette-fuller-support-human), Annette Fuller, Support Human, joins the show to talk about writing, storytelling, and helping people. And the Marvel Universe. And Harry Potter. And more.

I *love* doing this show — it’s now about a year-and-a-half old. This is the 37th episode. (We publish every other Wednesday.)

I love that it serves as a kind of documentation for a specific company with specific people at a specific place and time — and it’s also a good look away from the celebrities of the podcast world.

What are the people like who — sensibly! — have hobbies other than recording podcasts? (Well, they’re pretty cool!)
