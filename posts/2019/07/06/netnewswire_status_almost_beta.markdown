We’ve got just three things still to do [before we hit 5.0b1](https://github.com/brentsimmons/NetNewsWire/milestone/2):

One is a bug — when searching, a refresh or sync can [end search mode](https://github.com/brentsimmons/NetNewsWire/issues/791).

Another is kind of a documentation thing: we need a [set of sample AppleScript scripts](https://github.com/brentsimmons/NetNewsWire/issues/155). These will help people learn how to script the app — and it will also give us the chance to exercise the scripting support more thoroughly.

The third thing is to [write the Help book](https://github.com/brentsimmons/NetNewsWire/issues/2) and publish it on the web. Luckily I’m a pretty fast writer and I’ve written NetNewsWire Help books before. I’ll probably start with an older version and revise it for 5.0.

I *think* we can get to 5.0b1 some time in July — but, if we don’t, it’s because it’s summer and people are in and out due to vacations and ball games and cookouts and rock-and-roll shows. We’re super-eager to ship, but living life comes first. :)
