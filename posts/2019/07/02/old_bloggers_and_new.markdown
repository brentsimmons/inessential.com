I like to read what people write about RSS readers.

One of the themes goes something like this: “I used to use an RSS reader, then I stopped, years ago. I decided to try it again — so I imported my old list of subscriptions. Over half the feeds were gone or no longer updating! Pour one out for RSS.”

Here’s the thing: blogging is like any other human activity — some people stop and other people start. It’s natural.

And: nobody ever said your favorite bloggers would continue forever. It’s okay to miss your old favorites! I miss mine.

But here are a few examples of current blogs that I like that you might like:

* [Accidentally in Code](https://cate.blog/) - [Feed](https://cate.blog/feed/)
* [Becky Hansmeyer](http://beckyhansmeyer.com/) - [Feed](https://beckyhansmeyer.com/feed/)
* [Erica Sadun](https://ericasadun.com/) - [Feed](https://ericasadun.com/feed/)
* [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/) - [Feed](https://jvns.ca/atom.xml)

There are *plenty* more.
