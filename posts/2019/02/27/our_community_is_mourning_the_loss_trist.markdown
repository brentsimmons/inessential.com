Our community is [mourning the loss of Tristan O’Tierney](https://twitter.com/pbur/status/1100681415660756992) today.

I met him before the iPhone days, I’m pretty sure. While we were never close, I was always happy to see him at WWDC and similar events, and I liked him tremendously. I had somehow missed that he had been struggling. I wish so much that he had not been.
