Thereâ€™s a [measles outbreak in Washington State](https://www.doh.wa.gov/YouandYourFamily/IllnessandDisease/Measles/MeaslesOutbreak), where I live.

I try not to think about people not vaccinating their children. I [nearly died](http://inessential.com/2015/02/10/vaccines_again) as a result of having a [terrible case of chickenpox](http://inessential.com/2009/10/29/vaccines) during a blizzard. I live every day with damaged eyesight.

There was no chickenpox vaccine in those days. I sure wish there had been.
