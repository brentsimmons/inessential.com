The [latest build of NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) adds searching, one of the last important things to do before shipping.

It still doesn’t have syncing yet. There are a few bugs to fix. It doesn’t have a new app icon yet.

But this is the first build where I’d call it usable. The core features of an RSS reader are there.

If you were holding off, waiting for a usable build, then you can stop holding off.

(But if you still want to hold off trying it until I add FeedBin syncing — or your preferred system — I totally understand.)

Reminder: [it’s so basic it’s not even funny](http://inessential.com/2018/12/05/so_basic_its_not_even_funny)!
