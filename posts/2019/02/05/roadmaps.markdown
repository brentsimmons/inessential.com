I love it when companies or products publish a roadmap. Omni publishes one every year — [here’s the latest](https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/omni-roadmap-2019).

Today I ran across the <a href="http://blog.cocoacake.net/archives/1205">Fiery Feeds Roadmap 2019</a>. I’ve heard of Fiery Feeds, but I haven’t checked it out yet. Now I will, because the developer Lukas Burgstaller is a blogger and I enjoyed reading the roadmap.

Now, of course, I have to consider writing a NetNewsWire roadmap for 2019. The big thing on the list would be shipping 5.0. (I’ve been working on the app for five years! Time to ship.)
