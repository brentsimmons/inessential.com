In the [latest episode of The Omni Show](https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/episode/brent-simmons-marketing-human/), *I* am the guest. How does this even work? Do I interview myself? What’s going on here?

PS I like being on podcasts, and I’d be happy to be on yours, to talk about Omni stuff or my own stuff or both. I could probably even convince Ken Case to be a guest on your show if you want to talk about Omni apps and developing for Mac and iOS in 2019.

(My email address is no secret, and every spammer everywhere already has it, so I’ll just post it here: it’s <a href="mailto:brent@ranchero.com">brent@ranchero.com</a>.)
