I just got an email from Apple that two-factor authentication will be required for my Apple Developer account.

I have *two* accounts — one for personal use, one for development use — and so do lots of developers.

I don’t know how to make this work. None of my devices are ever signed in to my developer account. That account exists purely for building and distributing apps.
