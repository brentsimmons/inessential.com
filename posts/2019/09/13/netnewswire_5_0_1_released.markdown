NetNewsWire 5.0.1 is almost entirely a bug-fix release — see the [release notes](https://nnw.ranchero.com/2019/09/13/netnewswire.html) for the full scoop.

It includes one sort-of new feature: there’s now a checkbox in Preferences for turning off the unread count in the Dock. (It was a hidden pref — now it’s visible.)

#### Status

Here’s what else we’re working on:

* iOS/iPadOS app
* NetNewsWire 5.0.2 for Mac — which will mainly be about performance (yes, we can make it even faster)
* NetNewsWire 5.1 for Mac — tentative feature list includes content extraction and at least one more syncing option (but we might change our minds on these: anything can happen between now and then)

We might also distribute NetNewsWire 5.0.2 for Mac on the Mac App Store. No guarantees yet, of course, but work is happening in that direction. This goes to our goal of getting as many people as possible using RSS readers.
