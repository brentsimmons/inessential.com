The Xcoders meeting tonight should be pretty great — we’ve got a bunch of [lightning talks on new stuff from WWDC](https://xcoders.org/2019/06/11/this-thursday-seven.html).

It’s the Woodstock of today. In later years, more people will claim to have been at this meeting than could have fit in the room. :)
