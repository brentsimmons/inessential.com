One of my favorite moments of all The Omni Show episodes is in the [episode with Lanette Creamer](https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/episode/lanette-creamer-software-test-pilot), whose cat Navani has been featured on the [Omni microblog](https://microblog.omnigroup.com/) a couple times. ([Here](https://microblog.omnigroup.com/2019/04/04/meet-navani-she.html) and [here](https://microblog.omnigroup.com/2019/05/24/weve-got-more.html).)

From the transcript:

> **Brent:** Nice. So does Navani have any hobbies, obsessions?
>
> **Lanette:** I would say her top interest is murder, and it’s really a huge thing with her.  She loves it so much that she will literally be purring while she is trying to kill and destroy things.

That’s kitties for ya. :)
