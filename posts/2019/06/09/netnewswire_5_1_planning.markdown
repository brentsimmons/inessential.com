My job with NetNewsWire, more and more, is product manager. Which I don’t mind. :)

Anyway: I just combed through the issues list and picked out features for 5.1. I had a general idea of what I wanted going in, but it’s good to look at everything.

Here’s the list for 5.1:

* Feedly syncing
* Theme-able article view
* Localization — probably just French
* Text size settings for timeline and sidebar
* Catch up command (an easy way to mark-read before a chosen cutoff date)

Feedback is welcome, of course. Your ideas of what to do next might be different from mine.

Best place for feedback is on the [Slack group](https://netnewswire.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtNjM4MDA1MjQzMDkzLTNlNjBhOWVhYzdhYjA4ZWFhMzQ1MTUxYjU0NTE5ZGY0YzYwZWJhNjYwNTNmNTg2NjIwYWY4YzhlYzk5NmU3ZTc), but Micro.blog, Twitter, and email are good too.
