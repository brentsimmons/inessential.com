Person on Slack: “Public betas are up”

Me: “Bummer”

We go through this every summer. Public betas are a moving target, and they have bugs — and people think that app developers can fix any issue immediately.

If you need to get your work done — or, heck, even if you just expect your AirPods to work — you should install public betas on devices and machines that are *not* your main machine.

Even if you get extremely lucky and everything works with one release, the next public beta could change all that.

Right now I don’t know of any bugs with NetNewsWire 5.0 alpha on the Mac public beta. But it’s so early, and I haven’t personally tested it.

The Omni Group just put up a [blog post that recommends caution](https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/mac-and-ios-public-betas-and-omni-apps) with public betas.

Our friends at Rogue Amoeba have [tweeted about their apps not being compatible yet](https://twitter.com/RogueAmoeba/status/1143232738641752065). (They’re working on it, of course.)

There’s a [classic Merlin Mann tweet on the subject](https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies/status/146350449283440640).
