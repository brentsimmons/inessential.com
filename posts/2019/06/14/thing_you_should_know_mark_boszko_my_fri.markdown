Thing you should know: Mark Boszko — my friend, co-worker, and producer of the The Omni Show — did a podcast called [The Optical](https://www.opticalpodcast.com/episode/) that dives into movie special effects, and it has some amazing guests such as Douglas Trumbull.

If you like movies, you should listen to these.
