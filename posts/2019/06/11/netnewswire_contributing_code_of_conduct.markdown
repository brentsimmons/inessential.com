I finally got around to two things NetNewsWire needed: 1) a page describing how to contribute, and 2) a code of conduct.

They’re both on the same [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/brentsimmons/NetNewsWire/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) page.

If you’d like to contribute, the process is pretty straightforward. File a ticket, talk it over, write the code, do a pull request.

I don’t like too much process. This seems just right. That said, I’m still learning about how to manage an open source project, and any feedback on this (and anything else) is definitely welcome.
