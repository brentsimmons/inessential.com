[Liz Marley](https://twitter.com/emarley) and [Jared Sorge](https://twitter.com/jsorge) are the hosts of the brand-new Xcoders Community Podcast.

Last night they [published the first episode](https://xcoders.org/2019/06/24/welcome-to-the.html), an introduction. Future posts will include interviews and discussions of interest to our community of developers, designers, testers, support people, and writers.
