In the [latest episode of the Xcoders podcast](https://xcoders.org/2019/08/01/xcoders-podcast-august.html)…

> We recap the wonderful July meeting, Liz has a new blog, Jared launched his Scorebook update, and Jared previews his August talk on Xcode projects.

In the [latest episode of The Omni Show](https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/episode/omnigraffle-performance), I talk with folks on the OmniGraffle team about their latest update, which includes a bunch of significant performance enhancements.

Performance has been A Topic lately (as it always should be) — and, if you’re a developer, I highly recommend this episode to learn how a company like Omni does performance work.

I’m the guest in the [latest episode of Swift by Sundell](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/podcast/53). We talk about blogging, Apple’s Swift era, NetNewsWire, performance, and dynamic and declarative programming.

Swift by Sundell has become The Talk Show of Mac and iOS development. I recommend listening to *all* the episodes.
