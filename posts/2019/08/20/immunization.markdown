Before every major release I like to try and think of everything mean that people might say about the app. It’s fun!

So we just went through this exercise on the NetNewsWire Slack group. Here’s a taste:

* This took five years? I could write an RSS parser in a weekend.
* Can’t get my Twitter and Facebook feeds. Whatever.
* Doesn’t work with my Usenet host.
* The information density of the timeline is… lacking. What the hell.
* Not truly open source since it’s on a Mac.
* Not truly open source since it’s not GPL.
* No vim keys. Why bother.
* Regular people will never use an RSS reader. What’s the point?
* Brent’s last good idea was in 2002. Consider this a textbook case of coasting.
* Great app. Too bad RSS died with Google Reader.
* It totally didn’t pick up my subscriptions from the earlier version. How is this an upgrade?
* When does a 5.0 have fewer features than a 3.0? When it’s NetNewsWire.
* The echo chamber will love this app. They always do.
* Free app. Continues the race to the bottom. Pour one out for Silvio Rizzi.
* No way to send to Instapaper. Fuck it.
* Brent Simmons can't stop pursuing a technology that even Google famously admitted was not worth bothering with.
* If this app took five years, imagine how long it will take before it will actually sync with Feedly.
* Sure it’s free, but I bet the Feedbin people paid them off, because the only way to sync is to pay money to Feedbin.
* No iCloud sync? Jerks.
* No iOS app. The revolution happened on mobile, people. What the actual fuck.
* Shoulda been Catalyst. Dinosaurs wrote this app.
* Not on the Mac App Store? I guess they don’t want users.
* I would totally use this if it had just this one [feature x], which I can’t believe they shipped without. (Multiply this comment by 100, with a different feature x each time.)
* Area Man Can’t Let RSS Go

Some feedback will be factually inaccurate, but we like to imagine that too:

* I remember using NetNewsWire on OS 9, and it hasn’t really improved since then. They should make it a Cocoa app.
* Doesn’t work with web comics. POS
* Doesn't support 10.5.
* It should be free.
* You’d think they would have updated the design — but it looks *exactly* like NetNewsWire of old.
* Why the hell would they build on that aging code base from Black Pixel? I heard it doesn't even use ARC.
* No way to sync? What’s their actual problem?

See? The actual feedback will be nicer than the stuff we thought up. This provides a bit of immunization. :)

But, also, there will be negative feedback we didn’t imagine. That’s the gold!

Bonus from [Daniel Jalkut](https://red-sweater.com/), but not actually a criticism:
