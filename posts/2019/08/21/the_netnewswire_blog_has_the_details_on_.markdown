The NetNewsWire blog has the [details on NetNewsWire 5.0b5](https://nnw.ranchero.com/2019/08/21/netnewswire-b-probably.html) — which should be the last beta.

Still planning to do the 5.0 final release Monday morning, which really means doing the release on *Sunday* and pushing an announcement to this blog Monday morning. :)

The last things on my to-do list are actually writing that announcement and doing screenshots for the [NetNewsWire web page](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/). Easy. 🐯
