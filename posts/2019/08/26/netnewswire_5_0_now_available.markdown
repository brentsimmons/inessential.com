[NetNewsWire 5.0](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) is shipping!

In case you haven’t been following along until just now: NetNewsWire is an open source RSS reader for Mac. It’s free! You can just download it and use it. No strings.

It’s designed to be stable, fast, and free of bugs. It doesn’t have a lot of features yet, and that’s because we prioritized quality over features. We *will* be adding more features, of course, but not quickly. We’re also working on an iOS app.

It syncs using Feedbin. We’ll support more systems in the future (as many as possible).

I hope you like it!

#### Thanks to so many people

I want to especially thank Sheila Simmons and my family and friends.

This release took five years to make, and for four of those years it wasn’t even called NetNewsWire. It was just a year ago that I [got the name NetNewsWire back from Black Pixel](https://inessential.com/2018/08/31/netnewswire_comes_home) — and I thank them again for their wonderful generosity.

I also want to thank [Brad Ellis](https://twitter.com/BradEllis) for making the beautiful app icon and toolbar icons. Thanks to our major code contributors: [Maurice Parker](https://github.com/vincode-io), [Olof Hellman](https://github.com/olofhellman), and [Daniel Jalkut](https://github.com/danielpunkass). Thanks to [Ryan Dotson](https://nostodnayr.net/) for writing the Help book. Thanks to [Joe Heck](https://rhonabwy.com/) for looking after infrastructure issues (especially continuous integration).

Thanks to my co-workers and friends at [The Omni Group](https://www.omnigroup.com/) (which is a wonderful place to work). Thanks to the ever-patient and ever-awesome NetNewsWire beta testers on the Slack group and elsewhere.

And thanks to everyone who’s ever used the app in its 17-years-and-counting run. Because of you, NetNewsWire has been, and remains, the thrill of my career.
