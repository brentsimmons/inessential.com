I was in third grade when I got a severe case of chicken pox. This was in the days before there was a vaccine for it. When I returned to school, I found I couldn’t read the blackboard anymore, and I had to get glasses.

My eyesight kept getting worse in the years since, and it’s the worst that I know of among friends and family. With my contacts out, I can’t see my feet. I could trip over anything on the floor because I can’t actually see that far away.

I wear contacts instead of glasses because of the lack of peripheral vision. (These days I wear contacts *and* reading glasses when I’m at my computer or reading.)

I wish there had been a vaccine! I would have gladly had the better life with only normally impaired vision instead of extremely impaired.

#### Let me tell you how it was almost worse, though

We lived at the bottom of a quarter-mile-long hill. When it snowed, everyone parked their cars at the top of the hill, next to the highway.

I don’t remember the blizzard of ’78 at all because that’s when I had chicken pox. I had it so bad that it wasn’t just on my outside: it was inside. Eventually I couldn’t keep anything down — even the smallest sip of water would make me throw up.

But could I go to the hospital? My parents would have had to bundle me up, put me on a sled, and pull me up that hill, in the cold wind, with the road covered in deep snow, to get me to the car, to get me to the hospital. Would I have survived the trip? Unknown. I was weak and severely dehydrated. (I’ve never been as sick since. Not nearly.)

Long story short — we didn’t have to attempt the trip once I was able to hold down some cherry Jello. 🐣

But was this all better than getting a vaccine would have been? I could have died, and I’m *still* living with the effects. In a heartbeat I’d swap that experience for having had the vaccine.

When it’s your turn — it’ll be mine in a couple weeks — get the coronavirus vaccine! Don’t let this thing kill you or fuck you up forever.
