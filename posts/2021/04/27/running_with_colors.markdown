The [new CDC guidance](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/04/27/cdc-guidance-masks-outdoors/) says that unvaccinated people can “Walk, run or bike outdoors with members of your household” without a mask — which I take to mean that I, a currently half-vaxed person, can go for a jog by myself and leave the mask at home.

I actually <em>have</em> been jogging without a mask this whole pandemic — but only after dark, when the streets are nearly empty, when I have plenty of room to maneuver around the dog minders.

And so my next run — scheduled for tomorrow — will be a daylight run. I’m so looking forward to it! Getting back to normal one delight at a time. 🎸

PS Lots of rabbits in our neighborhood these days. (Technically: smolbrownbois.) Rabbits are really dumb in one specific way: when they see me running, they run away from me — by running in the exact same direction I’m running! They could go 90° — and they eventually do — but they take a while to figure it out, and they don’t seem to remember between runs.
