“Slow House,” song #3, is more exercise than song. Where most songs have a structure like ABAB or ABACAB or whatever, this one is just A. Not even AAA — just A.

I wanted to get some practice recording an acoustic guitar — it’s the first GarageBand thing I’ve done where one of the parts was from a mic (a Yeti Blue). (All the previous parts are via MIDI and Apogee Jam.)

I was thinking about “Starman” by David Bowie, and how the verse starts with iim and I chords, which is a little unusual. In “Starman” it’s Gm and F — but I have a great deal of antipathy toward Gm (it can go straight to hell, if you ask me), so I used Am and G as the chords here.

And that’s *all* I did. No chorus, no other changes. Still, though, I like how it weaves two melodies together, and I like how it all falls apart at the end.

I also like how some of the string-like GarageBand instruments bring kind of a vocal sound — I can almost hear words in there. (But there are none.)

It’s called “Slow House” because it’s slow (as an antidote to the very fast [Vampire’s Run](https://inessential.com/2021/02/16/vampires_run)) and because the piano is doing kind of a House thing.

It’s not until I make song #1,000 that I’ll make something people actually want to listen to more than once! I get that. I’m sharing anyway, because I think maybe it’s interesting to watch someone learn. 🐣
