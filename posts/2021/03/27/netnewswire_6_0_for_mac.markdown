NetNewsWire 6.0 for Mac has shipped! [See the blog post](https://nnw.ranchero.com/2021/03/27/netnewswire-for-mac.html) for a download link and list of changes.

The team of volunteers has done wonderful work — during multiple crises, including a pandemic — and produced one of the great NetNewsWire releases. Their reward is hearing that you love the app. 🐣🐥🎸

Next up for the team: we’re working on NetNewsWire 6 for iOS. The good news is that most of the code is shared between Mac and iOS — for instance, the iCloud syncing code is the same, and we’ve got this ship-worthy. But we still need to test and fix bugs. We’ll make an announcement on the [NetNewsWire blog](https://nnw.ranchero.com/) once we’re doing TestFlight builds.
