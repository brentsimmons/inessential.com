My aunt Jen and uncle Pete have adapted their show “Live From New York! He’s A Prom Date!” for live-streaming (yes, a live performance over the web). Tickets are just $10 or $15 for a couple.

Sheila and I saw a rehearsal and <em>loved</em> it.

You can [get tickets here](https://tum.booktix.com/view/1/07a81dcee937633a/) and you can [read more about it](https://www.twincities.com/2021/03/04/jen-maren-sally-jesse-raphael-livestream/) in the Pioneer Press.

The show is a true story: 16-year-old Jen didn’t have a prom date, and her mom got her on an episode of the Sally Jessy Raphael show. And… well, you should see it. You’ll laugh. You might cry a little. And you just might love it as much as we did. 🎉
