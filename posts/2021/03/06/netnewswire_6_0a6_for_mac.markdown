We’ve been doing a bunch of work on the crash log catcher — we even set up a Linode instance for just this one thing. (It’s the first server I’ve set up in 20 years!)

The thing is, we’re pretty much not getting crash logs for 6.0 test builds. (Less than half-a-dozen for 6.0a4, none at all for 6.0a5.) Which makes me suspicious of our system for catching and reporting crashes.

But every test I can come up with shows that the system is working just fine. So either nobody’s running these, or the app is just that stable.

Anyway — [here’s the latest](https://nnw.ranchero.com/2021/03/06/netnewswire-a-for.html).
