NetNewsWire 6 ‚Äî¬†[currently in beta](https://nnw.ranchero.com/2021/03/13/netnewswire-b-for.html) (Mac for now) ‚Äî¬†adds support for a bunch of RSS sync systems: BazQux, Inoreader, NewsBlur, The Old Reader, and FreshRSS. (NetNewsWire already supported Feedly and Feedbin: this makes the list a lot longer.)

If you‚Äôve held off on checking out NetNewsWire because you use one of the above, well, you don‚Äôt have to wait any more. Unless you want to wait for it to get out of beta, which is completely sensible. üêà

Not new in NetNewsWire 6, but worth remembering: NetNewsWire supports multiple accounts. You can have Feedly and Inoreader and FreshRSS, for instance. You can even have multiple of each. (You‚Äôd need multiple logins, of course.)

(We‚Äôre getting closer to our goal of supporting as many as possible of the existing systems. While I can‚Äôt guarantee we‚Äôll get to every single one, we‚Äôre certainly trying.)

#### How to add an account

Open Preferences. Click the Accounts icon. Click the + button near the bottom left of the window. You‚Äôll see a list of accounts as in [this screenshot](https://netnewswire.com/images/NetNewsWire6-Add-Account.png). Pick the one you want to add, and then follow the prompts for authentication and setup.

#### Bonus Tip

If you find an OPML file somewhere and just want to check it out without adding it to your current feeds, you can use NetNewsWire‚Äôs support for multiple accounts. (This is not new in NetNewsWire 6: this works in NetNewsWire 5 too.)

Create a new On My Mac account (you can have more than one) just for this OPML file, and then choose that account when importing the OPML file. That way you can see what‚Äôs in it, and you can copy any feeds you like into another account. When you‚Äôre done, you can just delete the temporary account (or make it inactive).

Example: if you‚Äôre an iOS developer, you might want to import some of the OPML files at Dave Verwer‚Äôs [iOS Dev Directory](https://iosdevdirectory.com/).
