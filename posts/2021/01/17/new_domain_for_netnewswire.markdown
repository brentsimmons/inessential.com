I was not foresighted enough, back in the early 2000s, to register the netnewswire.com domain — and so, of course, somebody else bought it with the hopes of selling it to me.

(These days the *first* thing you do is register the domain name. But that wasn’t as much a thing back then.)

I’ve been long resigned to never own that domain name. But then, just a few days before Christmas, I got an email from [Ben Ubois](https://benubois.com/), founder and developer of [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/), saying that he’d bought it for me. We transferred the domain pretty quickly after.

And then, this weekend, I got the new site set up — and now you can find NetNewsWire where it always should have been: [netnewswire.com](https://netnewswire.com/).

Thanks to Ben!
