The app is made of cat’s claws and fury. I try my damnedest to warn you off:

> You should probably skip it. It’s not a beta. It’s not even an alpha. It’s a *d* release — where *d*, which used to stand for *development*, now stands for *dangerous*.

…and…

> …let us satisfy your curiosity in advance: it’s just an app. It’s got some more features. You know the story, and you don’t need to run this if you’re just curious.

With that out of the way: the team has been doing great work! [This is the first build](https://nnw.ranchero.com/2021/01/17/netnewswire-d-for.html) with a Big Sur UI and app icon. It’s universal (Intel and Apple Silicon). It adds syncing via iCloud, Inoreader, NewsBlur, and others. It has special support for Twitter and Reddit feeds. Etc.

But I really do mean it when I say it’s early and dangerous. I’d like your help testing, but I need you to know it could be quite rocky and we may not have time to help you. You could lose data. You’d be doing a favor for the team which we have no way to repay — other than by eventually releasing the best app we can.
