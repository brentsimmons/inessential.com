I’ve been haunted since hearing, in the early days of the pandemic, that if we all wore masks for six weeks this thing would be *over*.

I was there. I’ve done that for six weeks, and another six weeks, and another. And now it’s worse than ever. It’s a challenge not to be angry.

There are healthy, uninfected people right now, today, who are excited for the vaccine and who will die before they get it.
