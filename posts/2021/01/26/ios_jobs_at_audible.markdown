We could be co-workers! I love working at Audible, and I think you would too. Plus — no small thing — you’d be working on an app that means so much to millions of people.

Scroll down [on this page](https://www.audiblecareers.com/newark-nj) to find a list of jobs (plus a link to a longer list). On the iOS team we have several engineering positions, a QA engineering position, and a software developer manager position.
