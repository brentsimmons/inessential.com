<p>Spider-man, Spider-man, does whatever a spider can... I spent hours watching the cartoon as a kid. He was my favorite.</p>

<p>Dude, I am like <em>so there</em> when this <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/columbia/spiderman/qt_high2.html">movie</a> comes out.</p>

<p>Speed Racer was my other favorite. They should make a movie of him too. I always wished Racer X was my big brother. And I wished I could drive the fabulous Mach Five.</p>

<p>Here he comes, here comes Speed Racer, he’s a demon on wheels.</p>
