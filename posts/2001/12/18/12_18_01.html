<p>Sometimes I wish that everyone on the net was at least 40 years old—or 60, better yet—so they were past that age of earnest self-righteousness. It’s boring and unattractive.</p>

<p>It’s in me too, and, you know what, I loathe it. It’s one of the worst things about being a (relatively, in my case) young man, that inner conviction of rightness. Ugh, so slimy. It just wells up, like some kind of irresistible biochemical event. The enemy of poetry.</p>

<p>The sad fact of biology is that every young man has the heart of a cop.</p>

<p>If you look, you’ll see it everywhere. (Here too.)</p>

<p>When I was a boy I was very hot-tempered. I was known for it.</p>

<p>Once, in middle school, another boy made fun of me. So I picked up a chair and tried to break it on his back, like in the movies.</p>

<p>I swung it like a baseball bat, like I was Mike Schmidt and I was swinging for the fences.</p>

<p>The chair didn’t break. School chairs don’t break, the way they’re bolted together, the way they’re made of plastic and metal.</p>

<p>The boy went down, flat on his face. He was bigger and stronger than I was, but I nailed him. The element of surprise was on my side.</p>

<p>We <em>both</em> got into trouble, we both got paddled by the principal.</p>

<p>Violence works. He never made fun of me again, and I never hit anybody with a chair again.</p>

<p>I still remember the feeling of when the chair connected to his back. I remember how it felt to watch him go down. It felt good, real good.</p>

<p>Perversely, it’s a memory I treasure, in part because I learned then that I must not and will not ever do anything like that ever again.</p>

<p>I am <em>not</em> a hot-tempered adult.</p>

<p>What if passionate, idealistic young men ruled? Wouldn’t you get a more fair society?</p>

<p>Actually, we tried this once—it’s called the Middle Ages.</p>
