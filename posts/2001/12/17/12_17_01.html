<p>Brent’s Law of Feline Behavior: The only way to stop a cat from crying at a window is to open the window; the moment you do that, he’ll go cry somewhere else.</p>

<p>I once made the observation that “hell is other people’s servers.”</p>

<p>I’d like to add to that. “Hell is also Network Solutions.” I’ve been trying to deal with some DNS issues for months. I’ve even faxed them. On their side nothing budges.</p>

<p>I will now call them names. They’re poopy-heads. They’re dumb-asses. They’re as stupid as Einstein was smart.</p>

<p>Network Solutions compares unfavorably to other modern ills, including the Greenhouse Effect, war, religious fundamentalism, illiteracy, racism, political correctness, Microsoft, and John Ashcroft.</p>

<p>When you think about Network Solutions, think of <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=smegma">smegma</a>.</p>

<p>They might as well be honest and change their name to Unsolvable Network Problems.</p>
