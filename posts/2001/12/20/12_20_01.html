<p>DRM—Digital Rights Management—is an issue on <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/12/20#whatIsDrm">today’s Scripting News</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing I keep not getting. Me, I don’t really want to play music or watch movies or whatever on my computer.</p>

<p>I’d much rather pop in a CD in my stereo or put a tape in my VCR.</p>

<p>So when DRM comes up, I just think to myself, “Who cares? Not me.”</p>

<p>But maybe lots of other people really do want to watch movies on their computers? I don’t know, it just seems like a weird thing to want to do. I mean, we already have TVs, right, and they’re pretty cool.</p>

<p>On principle I don’t like this whole DRM thing. But it doesn’t exactly get me up in arms, since it doesn’t affect me.</p>

<p>Or, at least I <em>think</em> it doesn’t affect me. I could be way wrong.</p>
