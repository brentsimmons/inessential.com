<p><strong>Referrer Pong</strong></p>

<p>It’s not really a game, just something that happens sometimes. It goes like this:</p>

<p>1. I notice on my referrers page a link from Site X.</p>

<p>2. So I click the link and go to Site X.</p>

<p>3. Then the person who runs Site X sees, on his or her referrers page, a link from my site.</p>

<p>4. They click on the link—and discover that the link is from my referrers page.</p>

<p>5. I look at my referrers page again, and see a <em>second</em> link from Site X, so I click on it.</p>

<p>6. And find that I’ve gone to Site X’s referrers page.</p>

<p>Remember to honk when you drive by <a href="http://www.vernfonk.com/">Vern Fonk</a>.</p>

<p>That funny scooter thing won’t catch on here in Seattle because it has no roof. It rains, you know. Oh well.</p>

<p>I have 15 human clones of me; they live in my basement.</p>

<p>We’ve formed a synchronized swim team. I make them wear bathing suits with numbers stitched on them so I can tell them apart.</p>

<p>When we go out to dinner we always reserve a private room and enter through the employees’ entrance so as not to frighten people.</p>

<p>Terrible fights break out whenever a magazine comes in the mail or I buy a new book. There isn’t enough to read for me plus 15 more of me. Brent #8 has a bloody nose and is crying right now because he still hasn’t read Time magazine from two weeks ago. Brent #3 is hogging it.</p>

<p>Despite the occasional fights, they’re all very cute when they’re asleep on the big giant mattress I put in the basement. I’ll post a picture when I get a chance.</p>

<p>I like to make up gross names for Harry Potter books. Some of the more printable include:</p>

<p>Harry Potter and the Dogs from Hell<br />

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Rock-Hard Member<br />

Harry Potter and the Magical Breasts<br />

Harry Potter and the Goblets of Mad Dog 20/20<br />

Harry Potter and the Men of Cell Block J<br />

Harry Potter and the Candy-Stripers<br />

Harry Potter and the Monster Spliff</p>

<p>Now let’s see if I get some interesting Google searches for Harry Potter hitting my site.</p>
