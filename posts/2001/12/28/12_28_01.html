<p>Top ten really mean put-downs:</p>

<p>10. I’d like you better if you were a corpse.</p>

<p>9. Just because you have an opinion doesn’t mean it’s correct.</p>

<p>8. When I think about things I’d like to do, the thing I think about most often is throwing a hair dryer in the bathtub with you.</p>

<p>7. I’d listen more closely to what you have to say, but I keep getting distracted by all the flying diarrhea.</p>

<p>6. Children and animals are scared of you for very good reasons.</p>

<p>5. My sympathies to your mother.</p>

<p>4. Sorry about the lack-of-brainpower thing. Gosh, that must be hard to live with.</p>

<p>3. I can tell your parents must have done like a ton of acid before you were born.</p>

<p>2. Don’t ask me, ask your lover—Satan.</p>

<p>1. Your life sucks because you suck.</p>

<p>Honorable mentions:</p>

<p>God’s ashamed about you. He’d like to take you back and try again.</p>

<p>On the Internet no one knows you’re a dog. Wait, actually, we all do know that about you, it’s just that we’re too polite to mention it.</p>

<p>If you don’t have low self-esteem, you should.</p>

<p>Don’t be paranoid. We’re not all out to get you. We don’t care nearly enough.</p>

<p>The reason you have a headache is because God is trying to kill you slowly.</p>

<p>You’re the reason no one wants human cloning.</p>

<p>Your momma called. She said, “Die, you unnatural freak of nature.”</p>

<p>I guess it’s a blessing you don’t know how ugly you are.</p>

<p>I used to like you, but then I stopped shooting up.</p>
