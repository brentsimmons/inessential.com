<p>There are times when I feel compelled to say totally inappropriate things, just to get a laugh or whatever. But rules of good taste, politics, getting along with people -- these things often prevent me.</p>

<p>For instance, today I was going to write just one sentence, and leave my weblog at that. "My dick is 10 1/2 inches long and thick as a roll of duct tape."</p>

<p>Imagine that sentence, alone. You might have spewed coffee out your nose. Or you might have decided never to visit my site again. Or you might have been concerned that I&#039;ve gone nuts.</p>

<p>Most likely you would have said, "Oh great, thanks for sharing, ya freakin&#039; freak."</p>

<p>Are the gods doing any better today than yesterday with their battle against stupidity, meanness, etc.? Nope. Things have gotten marginally worse. They&#039;re totally asleep on the job.</p>

<p>At the risk of sounding like a total geek, I&#039;ll admit to digging Klingon theology. They <em>killed</em> their gods. Sounds like a plan. They&#039;re apparently worthless anyway.</p>

<p>I&#039;m clearly not "getting along with people" today. Nor am I getting laughs, unfortunately. The worst of both worlds.</p>

<p>Guess what? Chickenbutt.
