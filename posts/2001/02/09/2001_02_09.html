<p>As I&#039;m probably the last to discover, there is indeed an <a href="http://aminakedornot.com/">AmINakedOrNot.Com</a>. (Warning: don&#039;t click there if you&#039;re at work -- many of the people actually are naked. You can remember the URL until you get home.)</p>

<p>Their sponsor is <a href="http://www.celebritydeathbeeper.com/">CelebrityDeathBeeper.Com</a>.</p>
