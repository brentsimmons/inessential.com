<p>"Against stupidity, the Gods themselves contend in vain."</p>

<p>-Friedrich von Schiller</p>

<p>How are the gods doing with mendacity, meanness, and ignorance? Not too good. Bummer.</p>

<p>Every word has two histories. One is the etymology -- where the word came from. The other is your personal history with that word.</p>

<p>The word "mendacity" sounds Latin based to me. Let me look it up... According to Merriam-Webster online, it comes from the word <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/netdict?mendacious">mendacious</a>, which is related to the word <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/netdict?book=Dictionary&va=amend">amend</a>.</p>

<p>I first came across the word mendacity when I was in jail. I was a teenager, barely 18, almost half my life ago. I was in a cell with about 30 other prisoners, in a cell designed to hold about 10. I spent the night on a mat on the concrete floor.</p>

<p>Some of the prisoners had some ratty old books. I hunted around for something to read, and found <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0451171128">Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</a> by Tennessee Williams. I asked the guy whose book it was if I could read it, and he let me, he didn&#039;t care.</p>

<p>The old man in the story, whose fortune many of the characters were after, kept complaining about the mendacity of his offspring. It was the first time I&#039;d run across that word. Mendacity. It was obvious from the context what it meant. I didn&#039;t bother hunting for a dictionary.</p>

<p>I remember envying the character Brick -- played by Paul Newman in the movie, which I later saw. Brick explained to Maggie -- the metaphorical cat on a hot tin roof, played by the fabulous Elizabeth Taylor -- that he would hear a click (note the rhyme) and would become perfectly apathetic. When I was that age, I wanted to hear that click, but never did.</p>

<p>I was arrested with, and stayed in the same cell with, a friend of mine, a bad kid. I was a bad kid, but never mind me, I wasn&#039;t anywhere near as bad as this kid.</p>

<p>It was his late-night drunken idea to break into the abandoned school where we let off the fire extinguishers in the hallway, tripped a silent alarm, and then were tracked and found by a German shepherd. The police officer warned us not to move, as Fifi the German shepherd didn&#039;t like that.</p>

<p>Consolation: as this happened so long ago, Fifi is undoubtedly dead by now, dead as a doornail, rotting in dog hell.</p>

<p>My friend, the bad kid, he wasn&#039;t so bad. Years later I started to refer to him in my mind as <em>coeur de lion</em>. With his friends he had a generous and large heart, as good a heart as anyone I&#039;ve ever met, it&#039;s just that he was also a confused, destructive alcoholic.</p>

<p>About a year later he hanged himself. Unlike with good King Richard, coeur de lion le premier, I can wait all I want, and he&#039;s not coming back.</p>

<p>There was an economy in jail. Once a week the prisoners could go to this little jail store. I wasn&#039;t there long enough to go to the store. One thing you could buy there was tobacco and rolling papers.</p>

<p>So what I did was trade parts of my next meals for cigarettes. Orange juice was particularly valuable: one orange juice for one cigarette. Other cigarettes cost more than one item.</p>

<p>I&#039;ve never seen anybody roll a cigarette (of any kind) as swiftly and efficiently as the guy I bought my cigarettes from.</p>

<p>Most of the prisoners I talked to were honest businessmen, fierce proponents of the free enterprise system, men whose lives were dedicated to the simple proposition of buying low and selling high. It&#039;s just that instead of scarves or pork futures they were selling a product they weren&#039;t supposed to sell, no matter how badly the public craved it.</p>

<p>I remember thinking that were no communists in jail, and that free enterprise does not stop behind bars.</p>

<p>Years later I read in the newspaper that smoking was outlawed in the jail. I wondered what that would do to the jailhouse economy. Bad things.</p>

<p>My friend&#039;s name was Steve Voris.</p>

<p><img src="/images/atom.gif" height="30" width="29" border="0" alt="" /></p>

<p>And so "mendacity" has long been one of my favorite words, as it makes me remember my friend, who had no mendacity in him.</p>

<p>I don&#039;t think he ever heard the click, except maybe once, I don&#039;t know.
