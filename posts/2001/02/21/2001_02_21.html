<p>I was in my twenties before I understood the old saying "don&#039;t cry over spilled milk." I had to have it explained to me.</p>

<p>All along I thought it meant -- don&#039;t cry because, you know, it&#039;s just milk, whatever, there&#039;s more milk you can have.</p>

<p>But really it meant that the milk is already spilled, so crying doesn&#039;t help anything, what&#039;s done is done.</p>

<p>So, with that in mind, I like to say things like "don&#039;t cry over spilled plutonium" or "don&#039;t cry over spilled vials of Ebola virus."</p>

<p>How do you tell a nun from a hooker taking a bath? One has hope in her soul...</p>

<p>Back to that milk saying. It&#039;s even dumber. You could just as well say "don&#039;t cry over milk before you spill it."</p>

<p>Because, after all, nothing bad has happened yet, so why cry.</p>

<p>So you can only cry during that fraction of a second while the milk is spilling. That doesn&#039;t give you much time. Do the best you can.</p>

<p><a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/">Sheila</a> taught me a cool hand gesture the other day.</p>

<p>Hold up your right hand, palm facing you.</p>

<p>Make a W with your index, middle, and ring fingers.</p>

<p>Now bend your elbow to the left -- make your forearm parallel to the ground.</p>

<p>Now you&#039;ve made an E, see.</p>

<p>W-E -- What Ever -- whatever.
