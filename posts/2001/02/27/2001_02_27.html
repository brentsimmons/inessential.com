<p>According to <a href="http://dmoz.org/Arts/Literature/World_Literature/American/20th_Century/">this page on dmoz</a>, Charles Bukowski, with 98 links, is by far the most popular 20th century American writer.  Jack Kerouac is a not-so-close second.</p>

<p>Hey, I like Hank as much as the next guy -- but more than Hemingway, Salinger, and Fitzgerald put together? No way.</p>

<p>And there were no -- count &#039;em, zero -- links for Raymond Carver, easily in the top five of American masters of the short story, arguably the very best ever.</p>

<p>For all the love passed out to the (over-rated) Beats, where&#039;s William S. Burroughs, the one who was actually good?</p>

<p>I&#039;m not criticizing dmoz. This is probably a pretty accurate picture of what&#039;s out there. I&#039;m criticizing the Web itself -- but with great affection, always. I guess what I&#039;m saying is that for the Web to become the ultimate research tool, an idea needs to take hold -- the idea that we need to fill in the blanks, that always going for the crowd-pleasing stuff isn&#039;t the best thing.</p>

<p>There&#039;s hard work to be done. But, you know, hard work can be more rewarding than the easy stuff.</p>
