<p>I&#039;ve started converting my tips into stories, so there will be a page that lists all the tips. At times like this I dig the <a href="http://macros.userland.com/basic/includeMessage">includeMessage</a> macro, which allows me to not have to maintain two copies of each tip. (They can appear both on archived home pages and as separate stories.)</p>

<p>And now here it is -- <a href="http://inessential.com/tips/">the Tips page</a>. I added it to the navigation for this site, so it should be pretty easy to find.
