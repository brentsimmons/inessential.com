<p>Happy President&#039;s Day!</p>

<p>Book recommendation: I recently read <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0802137350">The Making of the Prefident 1789</a> about George Washington -- it&#039;s funny, but good history too. One of those books that you want to keep reading instead of going to sleep at night.</p>

<p><a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/2001/02/19">Sheila</a> has lots more President&#039;s Day links.</p>

<p>Note to Radio users -- you can subscribe to Sheila&#039;s channel using <a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/xml/scriptingNews2.xml">this URL</a>. Her channel is good in part because she goes out and finds interesting and/or funny things that you probably haven&#039;t seen before, and she doesn&#039;t follow the fad of the moment. (No "All your base..." links, for instance. No StorTroopers.) And then there are the pretty <a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/2001/02/17">flower</a> <a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/photos/garden">pictures</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://nolondon.qwe.as/phantominlay">Phantom Inlay</a> is a new Python Tk client for Manila. <a href="http://nolondon.qwe.as/typhoon">Typhoon</a> is a similar client for Zope sites.</p>

<p>Don&#039;t forget about <a href="http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/faq">Archipelago</a>, also a Manila client, and <a href="http://zopefish.weblogs.com/manageZopeDocs">ZopeFish</a>, a Radio-based client for Zope.</p>

<p>The snow has all melted now, but the wind has returned and the wind is cold.
