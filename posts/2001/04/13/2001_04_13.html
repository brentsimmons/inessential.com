<p>I was asked by a Frontier user if my shutting down Ranchero Software would have any effect on my role at UserLand. Good question.</p>

<p>The short answer is no.</p>

<p>The longer answer is -- well, to the extent that I don&#039;t have to spend time on Ranchero stuff, that gives me extra time for UserLand stuff. But of course I don&#039;t spend hardly any time on Ranchero stuff.</p>

<p>Probably the most important effect is on my brain. It&#039;s less to keep track off and be concerned with. Ranchero is always in the back of my mind, a space I&#039;d rather reserve for something else.</p>

<p>I&#039;ll be able to retire two computers, which is always a good thing. You have no idea how much <em>pure joy</em> I get from turning computers off. (If you live in Seattle and might be interested in good deals on a 7200/120 and an 8500/132 that have proven their worth as servers, let me know.)</p>

<p>I&#039;ve been running servers for going on 6 years now, continuously, without cessation. I wish I could describe what this is like to the many of you who don&#039;t run servers, or who don&#039;t run servers that host other people&#039;s websites.</p>

<p>Even when everything is running smoothly, you&#039;re the guy who&#039;s responsible. And that&#039;s always there, it&#039;s always in your mind, it doesn&#039;t go away at 3 AM. The servers need to be up as people in Germany and Japan are hitting them. The World Wide Web could be called the Round-the-Clock Web.</p>

<p>Imagine it&#039;s a Saturday night, and you went to dinner with some friends. Though normally you don&#039;t drink, you had three glasses of wine, and you ate way too much fettucine. You get home at midnight all logy and weird and hoarse from talking. What do you do?</p>

<p>You check the servers, and hope to god they&#039;re all up, because you&#039;re not in the best position to deal with them. All you did was what half of America did this Saturday night -- but most of America didn&#039;t have to check the servers when they got home. Most of America didn&#039;t have to worry about servers going down during the chocolate mousse.</p>

<p>That&#039;s what never goes away, it&#039;s there <em>every minute of every day</em>, and it&#039;s a big part of why Ranchero is shutting down.</p>

<p>Turning off servers is <em>wonderful</em>.</p>
