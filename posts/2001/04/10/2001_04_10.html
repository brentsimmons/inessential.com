<p>Now and again it comes up that Mac users who download Frontier files need to set the file type and creator. There&#039;s a <a href="http://www.ranchero.com/software/webFileTypes/index.html">contextual menu plugin</a> that makes it easy.</p>

<p>The plugin mentioned above comes from <a href="http://www.ranchero.com/">Ranchero Software</a>, which is the company Sheila and I founded, along with several other people, in 1995. It was originally named WorldWide Power & Light.</p>

<p>Now, six years later, we&#039;re in the process of shutting down Ranchero Software. We turned off the business phone the other day. We have just a couple website hosting clients left.</p>

<p>Sheila and I will retain ownership of ranchero.com and wrldpwr.com. We&#039;ll also keep the small bits of software and the Frontier tutorials on the air, since they&#039;re still valuable. The template for the site will change, undoubtedly, but the links will still work.</p>

<p>Six years -- a pretty good run! It was never a huge money-making machine, but I remain proud of the fact that I was part of a company that was doing cool Web stuff long before Netscape&#039;s IPO, before Windows 95 was released, etc.</p>

<p>We were <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/">Frontier</a> users from the start, of course.</p>
