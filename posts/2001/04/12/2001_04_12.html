<p>I want to wear an eye patch over one eye like a pirate. Every day I&#039;d switch which eye was covered, so no one eye goes bad, but mainly I&#039;d switch eyes for the sake of fair play, which is important.</p>

<p>I&#039;d wink at people all the time. Of course they wouldn&#039;t be sure if I was winking or just blinking, since they can see only one eye. Sometimes they might think I was winking when really I was just blinking, which could probably get me before a judge these days. </p>

<p>I&#039;d be happy to take the stand in my defense. Naturally I&#039;d plead insanity. Who else would wear an eye patch for fun. Only crazies.</p>

<p>I&#039;ve mentioned this before -- the word "articulate" is some sort of code word I haven&#039;t figured out.</p>

<p>It&#039;s used almost solely to describe black men. As in, "Colin Powell is smart, accomplished, and articulate."</p>

<p>No one ever called Dick Cheney articulate, even though he is.</p>

<p>What&#039;s new to me is now people are starting to call gays articulate.</p>

<p>The news AIDS czar is a gay man. I heard the attorney general talking about him on TV. In the space of a minute he called him articulate three times.</p>

<p>As if it&#039;s some sort of surprise that a gay man (or a black man) would speak English well. Holy cow.</p>

<p>I mean, holy fucking shit, what&#039;s with this word.</p>

<p>I think it&#039;s like when in the old days people would say -- "Leon&#039;s a credit to his race." Or, "Brian&#039;s a credit to his people." Really they were talking about someone who spoke well, but also "knew his place" well and didn&#039;t rock the boat. That&#039;s what articulate sort of means. It&#039;s a defense -- don&#039;t worry, folks in Peoria, we hired a black man or a gay man or whatever, but don&#039;t worry, he&#039;s <em>articulate</em>, you can rest easy at night.</p>

<p>Update: okay, so one person once <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:www.denverpost.com/opinion/lett1011.htm">called Dick Cheney articulate</a>. (Thanks to <a href="http://iowa.weblogger.com/">John VanDyk</a> for the pointer.)</p>

<p>Well, no one ever called <a href="http://www.salon.com/people/col/pagl/2001/04/11/china/index.html">George Bush articulate</a>, unless it was as a joke.</p>

<p>I walked 22 miles of barbed wire. I use a cobra snake for a necktie. I got a brand new house on the road side -- made outta rattlesnake hide.</p>

<p>There&#039;s a little bitty chimney built up on top -- made outta human skulls.</p>

<p>Come on baby take a walk with me Eileen and tell me who do you love.</p>
