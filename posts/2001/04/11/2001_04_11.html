<p>I finally was able to get a copy of the May issue of Wired with the profile of Dave. No stores had it yet -- I had to have it delivered by Kozmo. Sheesh.</p>

<p>Of course, being no more or less self-centered than anybody else, I wanted to see if I was quoted in it. (I was.)</p>

<p>I was also described: "...he shares Winer&#039;s vision, but he&#039;s as calm as Data on the bridge of the Enterprise."</p>

<p>This Star Trek fan is pleased.</p>

<p>Update: <a href="http://www.inessential.com/melissa/">my cool sister</a> writes me to ask -- "Is he Brent Simmons, or Brent Spiner??????"</p>

<p>(Note to Melissa: your weblog is due for an update.)</p>
