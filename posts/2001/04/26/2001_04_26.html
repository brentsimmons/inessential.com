<p>This is <a href="http://www.tvturnoff.org/">TV Turn-off Week</a>. I didn&#039;t turn off my TV.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s why.</p>

<p>***Survivor</p>

<p>America is more and more divided into groups based on interests, religious beliefs, ethnicity, addictions, sexual orientation, etc. (In some ways the Web accelerates this.)</p>

<p>While I think it&#039;s good that people find and form communities, I also can&#039;t stand that people have less and less in common with each other.</p>

<p>For better or worse, TV shows are one of the few things we have in common.</p>

<p>Okay, it&#039;s not great, but it&#039;s <em>something</em>. And something is far better than nothing in this case.</p>

<p>There&#039;s another side to this -- when I talk to a hypothetical relative on the phone, a relative who wouldn&#039;t describe himself as part of any intellectual elite, I absolutely refuse to look down on this person for enjoying Survivor. I enjoy Survivor too.</p>

<p>When people complain that intelligent discourse is becoming more and more rare in America, and that the minority who do enjoy such conversations are more and more marginalized, I say -- damn it, it&#039;s your fault. The "intellectual elite" or whatever isn&#039;t some victim here. It&#039;s years of snobbery and epater le bourgeoise at work.</p>

<p>I enjoy intelligent discourse also, but I work hard not to be a snob.</p>

<p>***Baseball</p>

<p>Speaking of working hard... I work hard at my job. Baseball gives me honest pleasure. I can relax and recharge.</p>

<p>My inner Protestant tells me there must be something wrong with it. But, you know, it&#039;s not fattening or immoral. Watching baseball doesn&#039;t hurt anyone else.</p>

<p>(It&#039;s also another thing I have in common with people around me. I can talk to strangers on the street about how the Mariners are doing.)</p>

<p>Sheila needs to relax and recharge too -- she works as least as hard as I do at a very difficult job. So we watch baseball together. We jump out of our chairs and high-five when Edgar hits a two-RBI double. When Sasaki throws <em>the thang</em> to strike out the last batter in the ninth we hoot and holler. It&#039;s fun. We pretend we&#039;re at the ballpark.</p>

<p>Honest uncomplicated pleasures are hard to come by in the year 2001. When you&#039;ve found one, don&#039;t let go. Pleasure is a human need.</p>

<p>***The History channel</p>

<p>TV actually is educational. I especially enjoy the History channel, PBS, Animal Planet, and the Discovery channel.</p>

<p>The education isn&#039;t perhaps as in-depth as a book. But I wouldn&#039;t learn about many of these things otherwise.</p>

<p>For instance, I watched a series about Napoleon. I probably will never read a book about him, but I didn&#039;t mind spending a few hours watching TV about Napoleon. Does that make me bad or lazy? No way. I&#039;m reading books about other things.</p>

<p>And TV has some advantages over books. If you want to hear what things sound like, see what they look like, TV shows you. For instance, I could read all the books I want about tigers, but until you see one you don&#039;t really know how they move or what their growl sounds like.</p>

<p>One of the benefits is the randomness of TV. For instance, I didn&#039;t realize how interesting wolves are until one day when flipping around we ran across a documentary about wolves being reintroduced to Yellowstone park. Later I got the book about it. But I might never have had this pleasure, this interest, if I hadn&#039;t seen it on TV.</p>

<p>So, hey, TV, hey, thanks for being there. I won&#039;t turn you off.</p>
