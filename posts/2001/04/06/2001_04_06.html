<p>I&#039;m going to go out and see if the new Wired is at the grocery store. Maybe I&#039;m quoted in the article on Dave? I&#039;m nervous that maybe I said something weird. Cross my fingers I didn&#039;t.</p>

<p>History of the Web... The <a href="http://www.ranchero.com/wrldpwr/javascriptzen.html">JavaScript Zen Generator</a> is something I did a long, long time ago. Six years later it&#039;s still enlightening those who seek wisdom and truth and something to do during lunch.</p>

<p>You might note that the page mentions Dave Winer and UserLand Software -- this was before I worked for UserLand.</p>

<p>Yes, young ones, there was such a time, when Netscape roamed the earth and I did my coding on a Quadra 605.</p>
