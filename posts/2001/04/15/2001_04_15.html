<p>Sheila and I went to see <a href="http://www.hamletinseattle.org/">Hamlet</a> last night. We enjoyed it thoroughly.</p>

<p>One of the first weblogs I read this morning was Glenn Fleishman&#039;s -- and to my surprise, he&#039;s complaining about the <a href="http://glennf.weblogs.com/2001/04/15">seating</a> at the theatre. Right on. My ass was not happy. I kept telling it that the play&#039;s the thing, but it kept saying, hey, ouch.</p>

<p>I tend to forget physical discomforts within a couple days, so I&#039;ll just remember the play, which is lucky.</p>
