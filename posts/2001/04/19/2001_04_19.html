<p>I watched the launch of the space shuttle Endeavour this morning. It never gets old.</p>

<p>Before it even cleared the tower I yelled at the TV. Go!</p>

<p>To give you an idea how fast it goes: three minutes after launch, once the solid rocket boosters have dropped away, if the shuttle decides to abort the launch, they&#039;re set to coast into <em>Spain</em>.</p>

<p>I also learned how you officially become an astronaut. You&#039;re not an astronaut until you reach space and the shuttle commander says to you: "Welcome to space."</p>

<p>Welcome to space. I&#039;d love to have someone say that to me some day. Sheila has told me that she&#039;d go to space with me.</p>

<p>I was really glad that all this Napster stuff is over so I could finally unplug the speakers from my computer and hide them away in the closet.</p>

<p>Less is more.</p>

<p>You can&#039;t see your own face, only reflections or pictures of it.</p>

<p>You can see your nose a little bit. Sometimes I close one eye and pull my upper lip so I can see it. It&#039;s weird to see part of your face directly, however blurry.</p>

<p>Try it.</p>

<p>Whenever people ask me what I want for Christmas or my birthday I always say I want less. I want anti-gifts. I want people to come and take away things I don&#039;t want anymore.</p>

<p>Objects are not weightless; objects have mass. The weight of unwanted objects is double that of wanted objects.</p>

<p>I <em>almost</em> retired one of Ranchero&#039;s servers last night. Came so close, but then it was too late at night to go on. Perhaps tonight. I think when it happens I&#039;ll throw a party.</p>

<p>Music to my fingers:</p>

<p><code>shutdown -h now</code></p>

<p>I wish this were a command:</p>

<p><code>shutdown -h "now and forever, dammit, and get outta here"</code></p>
