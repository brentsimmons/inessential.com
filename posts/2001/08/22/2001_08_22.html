<p>Seeking monitor recommendations... I want a 19" trinitron (or with equivalent image quality). I&#039;ll be using it on a Mac running OS X, but most monitors are compatible, so that&#039;s not a big deal. Any preferences?</p>

<p>I imagine it&#039;s the same for everybody -- there are stories I wish I could tell, but they&#039;re too personal or they&#039;re someone else&#039;s stories. I wish I could tell them because they&#039;re so funny.</p>

<p>When a story is funny, it&#039;s often because one&#039;s expectations of how it would go were totally thwarted.</p>

<p>But in that thwarting an interesting observation is made. (Otherwise it wouldn&#039;t it wouldn&#039;t be a joke, it would be surrealism.)</p>

<p>Take this old joke:</p>

<p><blockquote>A grasshopper walks into a bar. The bartender says, "Hey, we have a drink named after you."</p>

<p>The grasshopper says, "Oh, you have a drink named Marvin?"</blockquote></p>

<p>Of course! The grasshopper thinks of himself as Marvin, not as a representative grasshopper.</p>

<p>For kicks, here&#039;s the surreal version of that joke, which is kinda funny, maybe, but in a nervous way.</p>

<p><blockquote>A grasshopper walks into a bar. The bartender says, "Hey, we have a drink named after you."</p>

<p>The grasshopper says, "Shut up, bluefish."</blockquote></p>
