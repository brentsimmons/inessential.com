<p>Since moving the servers out of my office last week, I&#039;ve been enjoying a new experience -- a quiet work environment with plenty of desk space.</p>

<p>Does this make a difference? You bet.</p>

<p>I&#039;m not sure which was worse, listening to all those fans and hard drives all day or the plain hell of claustrophobia.</p>

<p>Either way, my office is now a utopia.</p>
