<p>By the way, I get my Trek news from a sort-of Star Trek weblog: <a href="http://trektoday.com/">TrekToday.Com</a>.</p>

<p>More about software and art...</p>

<p>I&#039;m with George Orwell: control of language is control of thought is control of the human spirit.</p>

<p>The word "art" was formerly reserved for creative expression of a type fundamentally different from software, cooking, cabinetry, home decorating, and so on.</p>

<p>The greatest possible work of software can&#039;t move a person the way Hamlet does.</p>

<p>In deciding that software is art, we forget about that distinction. We forget what Hamlet can do; we lose the capacity to appreciate art. Art is flattened to its lowest common denominator.</p>

<p>Then art is gone.</p>

<p>Good software is, or can be, creative expression. It can be beautiful. But why do we have to use the word "art?" Isn&#039;t it enough that it is what is? It&#039;s already so many wonderful things.</p>

<p>I imagine a terrible future when everyone is congratulating themselves on living during a renaissance, where art is all around.</p>

<p>I&#039;ll be sitting alone in the corner, gnawing my legs off, sticking forks in my palms, complaining that art is dead.</p>
