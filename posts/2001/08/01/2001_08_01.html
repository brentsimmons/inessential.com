<p>Happy Birthday to <a href="http://www.inessential.com/Melissa/">Melissa</a>!</p>

<p>I&#039;m looking for, and not finding, a console-based outliner that runs on OS X. If you know of one, please let me know. Thanks!</p>

<p>Maybe I&#039;m touched in the head for making a big point of this -- but I have to take exception to the Talking Moose&#039;s calling us programmers <a href="http://talkingmoose.manilasites.com/discuss/msgReader$53?mode=day">software artists</a>.</p>

<p>Don&#039;t call me an artist.</p>

<p>Software is art-like -- it&#039;s creative work, difficult, requiring concentration, perspiration, and inspiration. The result can provoke aesthetic admiration. Software can be beautiful.</p>

<p>But it&#039;s not art. Despite my politically correct education, I maintain the Western notion that art is literature, painting, sculpture, music, and architecture. (Film and photography may qualify, but the final decision hasn&#039;t been made.)</p>

<p>To call software "art" is to continue the <em>inflation of everything</em>.</p>

<p>What I mean is, pretty soon everything is art. Pretty soon the bagger at the grocery store wins a prize and a government grant and a show at that art gallery on the corner.</p>

<p>It&#039;s like, when I was a kid, in order to win a trophy your baseball team had to be the best. Nowadays kids get trophys just for showing up.</p>

<p>There&#039;s grade inflation too. I remember when I was at college, the most common grade was an A. More As were given than any other grade. How could this be?</p>

<p>I don&#039;t need the flattery. I don&#039;t need to think of myself as a software <em>artist</em> in order to make software. If you&#039;re a programmer, and you do need that flattery, maybe it&#039;s time to consider another career.</p>

<p>There&#039;s nothing wrong with distinctions and standards.</p>

<p>If you say to me -- Hey Brent, I really like what you do, it&#039;s cool and good -- then I&#039;ll say -- Thanks!</p>

<p>But if you call me an artist I&#039;ll say -- feh.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I agree with much of the rest of the Moose&#039;s story. Just not that particular choice of words.</p>

<p>When everything is art, there&#039;s no such thing as art anymore.</p>

<p>While I&#039;m expressing unpopular opinions (which is fun for me), here&#039;s another one:</p>

<p>That Beatles song "All You Need is Love" causes my stomach acids to over-produce. I get gassy and bloated and have to go lie down.</p>

<p>You know the song, you can hear it in your head. Blaaaaah, blaaaah, love. Love, blaaaah, blaaaah. (It sounds like. To me.)</p>

<p>That dippy, droopy sound, the laughing horns -- the first time I heard it I thought it was a parody.</p>

<p>What nauseates me is the idea that love is some simple answer to all our ills. Why? Not because I don&#039;t believe in love or love&#039;s power -- but because I think love is much more powerful than all that.</p>

<p>Love is not some formula, it&#039;s not how to save the world in one easy step. Love is the rose with thorns, the tiger with claws and teeth, the beautiful bird of prey. It&#039;s <em>more</em> powerful, anarchic, out-of-control than any simple answer.</p>

<p>I remember reading Milan Kundera writing about the Prague Spring. The Russian soldiers entered Czechoslovakia to put down the revolution. When asked why, they said "because we love our Czech comrades."</p>

<p>Key point: <em>they were not lying</em>.</p>

<p>How many wife-beaters love their wives? The vast majority, I&#039;d be willing to bet, no matter what scums they are.</p>

<p>Remember Othello, who "loved not wisely but too well."</p>

<p>I&#039;m with Kurt Vonnegut when he says all we need is courtesy. There&#039;s a simple answer for you, but one that people don&#039;t want to hear. It&#039;s not very lyrical.</p>

<p>I would have called it "common courtesy" but we all know it&#039;s not common.</p>
