<p>That SirCam virus appears to be a permanent fact of Internet life. I&#039;m still getting lots of email.</p>

<p>I think we&#039;re fighting the virus war with both hands tied behind our back. We need to do as the body does -- we need antibodies and white blood cells that roam and replicate as virii do.</p>

<p>In other words, someone needs to write and release an anti-SirCam virus that goes around deleting the SirCam virus.</p>

<p>Speaking of volplaning -- I dreamt last night that I was in an airplane that made a crash landing on a country road somewhere in the Appalachians.</p>

<p>As we were going down, we were all scared.</p>

<p>Then a voice came on the intercom giving us instructions. We all started laughing, since we were about do die, but we&#039;re all like -- "Well, at least they give you something to do! How considerate. Takes your mind off things."</p>

<p>I remember the voice on the intercom said -- "Put your feet on the floor, if there is one available."</p>

<p>That made us laugh too. They thought of everything! The floor might have given way, after all.</p>

<p>Then finally we landed, minus landing gear and one wing -- and it was the smoothest, most beautiful landing ever. The airplane finally stopped still.</p>

<p>I looked out the window at some cows in a field. Then, something something, cut to something weird, I forget, you know how dreams are weird.</p>
