<p>I just hit my funny bone. It’s not funny. It makes me mad at Microsoft. Everything makes me mad at Microsoft.</p>

<p>The leaves need to be raked. Damn that Redmond software monopoly.</p>

<p>It’s raining again. Just give me five minutes alone in a room with Steve Ballmer.</p>

<p>Global warming—it’s probably Bill Gates’ fault.</p>

<p>By the way, the above is an example of hyperbole.</p>

<p>One of the cardinal rules, growing up, was <em>don’t exaggerate.</em></p>

<p>(That’s how WASP culture is passed from generation to generation.)</p>

<p>But me, I love to exaggerate. I’m a big fan of the out-of-proportion. As I’ve said before, proportion, balance, symmetry, harmony—yawn yawn yawn—hold little aesthetic appeal for me.</p>

<p>Except that I love the word “symmetry” in Blake’s famous poem.</p>

<p><pre>

Tyger Tyger burning bright,

In the forests of the night,

What immortal hand or eye, 

Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

<br /><br />

In what distant deeps or skies, 

Burnt the fire of thine eyes?

On what wings dare he aspire?

What the hand dare sieze the fire?

<br /><br />

And what shoulder, & what art,

Could twist sinews of thy heart?

And when thy heart began to beat,

What dread hand? & what dread feet?

<br /><br />

What the hammer? and what the chain,

In what furnace was thy brain?

What the anvil? what dread grasp,

Dare its deadly terrors clasp!

<br /><br />

When the stars threw down their spears

And water’d heaven with their tears:

Did he smile his work to see?

Did he who made the Lamb make thee?

<br /><br />

Tyger Tyger burning bright,

In the forests of the night,

What immortal hand or eye, 

Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
