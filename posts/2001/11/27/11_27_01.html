<p>One for the money, two for the show, three to get ready—now go cat go!</p>

<p>Speaking of cats—I’m lucky that Papa is a shoulder cat. Half the time when I pick him up he clambers up on to my shoulder. Then we walk around the house, him sitting on my shoulder or draped around the back of my neck. It’s fun. Maybe it’s the Maine coon in him.</p>

<p>If you have a shoulder cat, then you’re lucky.</p>
