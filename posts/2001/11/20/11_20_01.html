<p>When I was a teenager I was an anarchist.</p>

<p>Then one day I learned I wasn’t an anarchist anymore. I read Ursula K. LeGuin’s <a href="http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~brians/science_fiction/dispossessed.html">The Dispossessed</a>. It’s about two planets: one an anarchy, the other most definitely not.</p>

<p>The thing was, I thought the anarchy planet was so boring and dreary and puritanical—and the other planet, for all its being fucked-up and unfair, was much more colorful and fun and glamorous and irrational and interesting. It would be easy to choose where to live.</p>

<p>And then I knew I wasn’t an anarchist. I was kinda sad about it, because my self-image was that of the radical anarchist revolutionary artist. So I had to drop the anarchist part.</p>

<p>A couple years later I read <a href="http://www.strangewords.com/archive/ecotopia.html">Ecotopia</a>, which describes a sort-of anarchy spanning northern California, Oregon, and Washington. It sucked. No way do I want to live in Ecotopia. Ugh. Blech.</p>

<p>From these books it appears that political anarchies are not particularly anarchic: they’re boring and everyone’s the same. So much for anarchy. Too bad.</p>

<p>Years later I discovered that <a href="http://www.philosophypages.com/ph/rous.htm">Rousseau</a> is the source of so much of this stuff. If there’s one philosopher I wouldn’t mind punching in the nose, it would be Jean-Jacques.</p>

<p>That’s not to say I don’t like Ursula K. LeGuin’s books. I think The Dispossessed is a good book. And I loved <a href="http://www.sciencefictionmuseum.com/stories/reviews/snop003.html">The Lathe of Heaven</a>.</p>

<p>A counter-example: <a href="http://www.zompist.com/heinlein.html">The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</a> describes an anarchy on the Moon. I wouldn’t mind living there. It’s a very different anarchy—a fun and diverse anarchy—than the anarchies described elsewhere. It’s more a transplanted and scratched-up Jeffersonian anarchy than a Roussea-ian anarchy.</p>
