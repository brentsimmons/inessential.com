<p>Okay, here’s an example of really excrementally bad UI design.</p>

<p>I had to reboot Windows because it had gone crazy. So I went out to the grocery store, took a friend to the airport, re-painted my bathroom, discovered some new prime numbers, just to kill some time while waiting for it to re-boot.</p>

<p>Then when I got back there was a modal dialog box on my machine.</p>

<p>It said: Register Your Product. It had three buttons: Remind me in two weeks, never register, or register now.</p>

<p>Okay—but <em>which freakin’ product?</em></p>

<p>I had no idea. So I clicked Register Now, figuring that the next thing I’d see is a dialog box that would somehow clue me in as to which product I’m registering.</p>

<p>You know what happened when I clicked the Register Now button?</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>Well, something. The dialog box went away. But nothing else happened. I just sat there staring at my desktop. Nothing continued to happen, until finally I fired up Visual C++ and went about my work.</p>

<p>I have no idea which “product” is responsible for this.</p>
