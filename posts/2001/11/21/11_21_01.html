<p>Tomorrow is Thanksgiving! I’d like to thank Papa for being so cute, but he’d probably just bite me.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wish I could sing like Kim Carnes. “All the boys think she’s a spy...”</p>

<p>But my favorite female singer is Martha Reeves of the Vandellas. Dancing in the Street, Heat Wave, Jimmy Mack.</p>

Whenever he calls my name

Soft, low, sweet and plain

I feel, right here

I feel that burnin’ flame

</pre></p>
