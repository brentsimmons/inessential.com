<p>It’s been said by other people, but it’s worth repeating: the best programmers these days know how to use the Web to solve problems.</p>

<p>I’m not talking about just knowing how to find things on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/">MSDN online</a> or <a href="http://developer.apple.com/">Apple’s developer site</a>. As often as not, the problem I need to solve hasn’t been addressed there—but somebody, somewhere has run across the same thing and found a solution.</p>

<p>It also requires some flexibility and an open mind. For instance, more than once I’ve run into a case where there are Visual Basic examples that show how to fix a problem, but nothing in C. No matter—a willing programmer can translate, even without having any VB experience.</p>

<p>Of course, my hope is that any programmer who uses the Web also gives back to the Web, posts their solved problems, tips, sample code, and so on. (I’m lucky that I get to do this as part of my job.)</p>

<p>For a programmer these days, knowing how to learn on the Web is more important than knowing any particular language or environment.</p>

<p>Were I interviewing a programmer today (I’m not), I wouldn’t ask as much about their education or experience with specific tools as I would about their use of the Web. And, because I believe in a sort-of instant Web karma, I’d also find out if the Web for them is a two-way street.</p>

<p>It’s possible that I wouldn’t hire anybody who doesn’t already have a weblog. Given the choice between a programmer with a computer science degree and a programmer with a weblog—everything else being equal, I’d hire the programmer with a weblog.</p>

<p><a name="jakob">I’m</a> a big fan of usability guru Jakob Nielsen—but I don’t go to <a href="http://www.useit.com/">his site</a> very often because I find it hard to use.</p>

<p>Some things bug me about the home page. The big colored boxes have no borders—so they sort of bleed into the white space. It looks amateurish (in the negative sense).</p>

<p>The two yellows clash (to my eyes).</p>

<p>The search box in the upper right is too large—it suggests that, to have any hope of finding what I want, I’m going to have to type in multiple keywords.</p>

<p>Worst of all, the margins are very small. I appreciate that the page re-flows as I resize my browser window, but I have difficulty reading with small margins and really wide blocks of text.</p>

<p>This is even worse—much worse—when reading <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20011125.html">one of the AlertBox columns</a>. Again, liquid design is good, but tiny margins, super-wide lines of text, and long paragraphs is just way too difficult to read.</p>

<p>So what I invariably do when I read one of his columns is resize my browser window width to about one-third of its normal size. I <em>have</em> to, in order to read it.</p>

<p>So, before following a link to his site, I always stop and pause and wonder if I feel like dealing with it. Most of the time the answer is no. Which is too bad for me.</p>

<p>By the way—this is a case of the pot calling the kettle black. I know it.</p>

<p>He also tells me we have a terrible invisible mouse problem here in the house. And we’re infested by ghosts.</p>
