<p>Over the holiday weekend I cleaned the gutters. You haven’t lived until you’ve stood on the creaky top step of a ladder and reached up and dug your fingers into a cold slurry of leaves and pine needles, bits of which fall on your face as you transfer it to your bucket.</p>

<p>And then there’s that smell.</p>

<p>The only reason this post exists—because who cares about my gutters?—is so I could use the word “slurry” in a sentence.</p>
