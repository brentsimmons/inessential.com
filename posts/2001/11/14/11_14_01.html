<p>There seems to be a disrespect for Carbon among many OS X users. The refrain I keep hearing, not necessarily applied to our software but to many other people’s software, is “why didn’t you use Cocoa?”</p>

<p>The argument, from people who like to tell developers what to do, is that Cocoa apps are faster and more OS-X-like.</p>

<p>Now, I like Cocoa alot. I’ve been learning it a little bit at a time when I have spare moments. The more I learn the more I like. I’m starting to believe the hype that, once you learn Cocoa, you can build apps more quickly in Cocoa than with any other framework.</p>

<p>But I don’t believe it’s faster. Objective-C is a dynamic, object-oriented language. Though I don’t have hard data, it’s a rule of thumb that straight C outperforms object-oriented languages. There’s a certain performance overhead associated with object-orientation—and my guess is that Objective-C, especially because it’s so dynamic, is far from being an exception.</p>

<p>It was true at first that Carbon lacked certain features present in Cocoa—Services support, for instance. But now Carbon has all that stuff.</p>

<p>Again—this is not to dis Cocoa. Were I starting a new Mac-only app, there’s an excellent chance I’d use Cocoa.</p>

<p>But there’s a certain lean elegance to a well-written C app that should not be dismissed easily. You get a finer level of control because there’s less going on behind your back. </p>

<p>A good C app is written with object-oriented principles, only you use structs and callbacks and function pointers. You do a lot of factoring, respect the principles of encapsulation and MVC design, etc. You don’t have to give up good programming practices just because you use Carbon.</p>

<p>What I’m saying is: Carbon is cool too. Don’t disrespect it. So much depends upon the developer.</p>

<p>Another benefit to Carbon, not to be taken lightly: if you want to port your app to Windows or Linux or whatever, starting with a Carbon app is easier than starting with a Cocoa app.</p>

<p>I’m lucky in that my first lessons in good programming practices began over 20 years ago. My parents were both programmers, and I was learning BASIC on my Apple II Plus.</p>

<p>Many dinner conversations could be summed up with these famous words: “Goto considered harmful.”</p>

<p>I was thick-headed. I preferred goto to gosub. (I was also 12.)</p>

<p>I’m an award-winning programmer. I even still have my medal.</p>

<p>In the eighth grade I went to some sort of programming competition in Delaware. There were kids from all over the state.</p>

<p>Our task was to write a BASIC app that sorted an array of strings.</p>

<p>I knew about a few sort algorithms, but we had a time limit, so I went with the easy one that I knew I could do: the bubble sort.</p>

<p>After I turned in my floppy with the program on it I decided to get out of there. There was no way I was going to win. Even though my program worked, surely other kids were using faster, more sophisticated algorithms.</p>

<p>So we went home.</p>

<p>Later I found out that I won. Someone from my school accepted the award on my behalf.</p>

<p>My conclusion—which, looking back, seems rather harsh—was that sometimes you <em>are</em> the one-eyed man in the kingdom of the blind.</p>
