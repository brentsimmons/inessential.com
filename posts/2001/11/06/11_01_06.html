<p>I get to vote today!</p>

<p>Excellent. I love voting. I love the ritual of going to the polls, going through the whole thing of looking up my name on the sheet, getting my ballot, making the marks, putting it in that machine. All the people there voting, and the volunteers—they’re all cool.</p>

<p>I’d say that it was like church for me, if church didn’t connote tedium and faceless authority. It’s like a cool joyous church, relaxed but excited.</p>
