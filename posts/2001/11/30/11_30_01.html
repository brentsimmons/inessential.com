<p>It’s obscure ’80s punk rock lyrics day.</p>

<p><pre>

I’m walking aroun’

with my feet on the groun’

blah blah blah

fuck you, narc

</pre></p>

<p>-“Unalive” by the Smart Nigels</p>

<p><pre>

I keep farting

I keep farting

I keep farting

My mom said get a load of you

My dad said get a load of you

I went in the closet to beeeeeeee alone

</pre></p>

<p>-“Boy in the Closet” by Prozac Delivery System</p>

<p><pre>

Something about love

Makes me want to shove

My face in the mud

When I get horny

</pre></p>

<p>-“Big Girl” by Protruding Television</p>

<p><pre>

I’m a fetus

and you’re not

I wear small boots

I got tattoos

a pack of smokes

a quart of booze

</pre></p>

<p>-“Carousel” by Rocket Crash</p>

<p>If I were starting a punk rock band today, I’d call it Wireless Portal.</p>
