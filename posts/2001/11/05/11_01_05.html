<p>I hope it’s not terrifically crass of me, but I’ve got a complete system for sale—Seattle residents note.</p>

<p>It’s a 7200/120 Power Mac running OS 8.1. 40 MB RAM. I bet LinuxPPC would run quite nicely on it.</p>

<p>Also included: an AppleVision 1710AV 17" Trinitron monitor, a mouse, and—for any nostalgists out there—an authentic Power Computing keyboard.</p>

<p>$250, cash, and you have to drive over to my house to pick it up. <a href="mailto:brent@userland.com">Send me email</a> if you’re interested. Everything’s packed up in two boxes, ready for transport.</p>
