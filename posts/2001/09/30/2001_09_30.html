<p>Happy Birthday to <a href="http://www.inessential.com/mjdavis/">Mom</a>!</p>

<p>It may be another birthday for her, but when you meet her you&#039;re more likely to think she&#039;s my older sister than my Mom.</p>

<p>I got OS X 10.1 yesterday morning -- I had ordered the full package from MacMall a couple days ago since they promised to FedEx it for Saturday delivery. It worked!</p>

<p>First impressions are very good. I was afraid that Frontier and Radio would be broken, but so far that hasn&#039;t been the case. Other people <a href="http://frontier-osx.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$788?mode=topic&y=2001&m=9&d=30">using Frontier with 10.1</a> are reporting similar good news.</p>

<p>I was looking for a serious speed boost with 10.1, and I got it.</p>
