<p>I return from vacation tomorrow. It&#039;s been great!</p>

<p>To everyone who follows my love of Philly-area food: I had four or five Italian subs, a couple cheesesteaks, lots of TastyKakes, Herr&#039;s potato chips and cheese curls, Drake&#039;s cakes, Jersey tomato sandwiches, fresh kingfish (some of which I caught), and lots of sticky buns. It was an eating vacation.</p>
