<p>Remember the home page caching feature for Manila that came out yesterday?</p>

<p>If you have a Manila site, please turn it on. It will make your site faster and will make the server it&#039;s running on run more smoothly.</p>

<p>It&#039;s not just good for your site, it&#039;s a way of being a good Web citizen.</p>

<p>The pref can be turned on via your Editorial prefs page.</p>

<p><a href="http://editorial.inessential.com/discuss/">More about cats and kittens</a> on the discussion group. People love their cats. If you have one, it&#039;s easy to know why.</p>

<p>If you have a cat, please join in, either here or on your website -- I&#039;d love to hear your stories.</p>

<p>My cat&#039;s a poet. He doesn&#039;t write, of course. But he does poetry-like things.</p>

<p>A good poem often has something unexpected in it but that, in retrospect, seems just right.</p>

<p>We were lying in bed this morning, our faces a couple inches apart. I reached out my hand to pat his head.</p>

<p>He reached out a paw and put it on my eye, on my eyelid. He held it there.</p>

<p>I finally moved his paw. Then he put it back.</p>

<p>In case you missed it last night, Sheila put up <a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/2001/09/17">pictures of Papa</a>.</p>

<p>He&#039;s a gray-tabby/Maine-coon mix, about 3 months old.</p>

<p>I spent a while this morning dealing with the latest goddamn virus.</p>

<p>Our mail server doesn&#039;t have a Nuke Enclosures setting. I wish it did.</p>

<p>It does have a setting for maximum incoming message size, which I set to 50K. That won&#039;t stop all virii, of course, but it will stop the giant attachments that get sent around. The denial-of-service issue is the big issue with us, since we <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2001/09/18/importantDontOpenEmailEnclosures">don&#039;t open enclosures</a>.</p>

<p>Email enclosures have to go the way of the dodo. Though they seem convenient, in reality they cost too much in productivity.</p>

<p>We need a new convenient way of sharing files. It should be easy enough for executives to use, but not too easy -- it needs to have some deliberateness and security.</p>

<p><img src="/images/atom.gif" height="30" width="29" border="0" alt="" /></p>

<p>Let me be clear: <em>it&#039;s over for enclosures</em>.</p>

<p>No more. Finished. Au &#039;voir, auf wiedersehen, good-bye enclosures.</p>

<p><img src="/images/atom.gif" height="30" width="29" border="0" alt="" /></p>

<p>Even my laptop, my iBook, is getting hits from the new IIS virus.</p>

<p>God<em>damn</em> it.</p>
