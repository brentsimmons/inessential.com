<p><a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/2001/09/17">Meet our kitten</a>. He&#039;s named for Ernest Hemingway and Edgar Martinez.</p>

<p>I&#039;m going to do my part for the economy today -- I&#039;m going to buy some toys.</p>

<p>(Er, I mean, I&#039;m investing in my personal productivity.)</p>

<p>Gonna buy a 21" monitor for my Mac, a color printer, and a color pda (Visor Prism).</p>

<p>Of course, I&#039;m also working today. Me, I&#039;m in Manila-land, adding features and fixing bugs.</p>

<p>I held my stocks.</p>

<p>For me, the "new normal" includes a new ritual.</p>

<p>In the morning the flag goes up. In the evening the flag goes down (since it wouldn&#039;t be illuminated properly).</p>

<p>My kitten is a good friend to Ethernet cables -- if friendship is measured in bites per minute.</p>

<p>Was it right to use violence and the threat of violence to protect the Muslims in Bosnia?</p>

<p>Was it right to arm and train Afghanis in their defense against Soviet aggression?</p>
