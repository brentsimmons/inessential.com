<p>I don&#039;t like the word "meme."</p>

<p>The English language has so many more specific words -- idea, ideal, belief, creed, law, ethic, moral, rule, code, philosophy, conceit -- why not use them?</p>

<p>Specificity is a virtue in writing and speaking.</p>

<p>Yes, the word "meme" does remind one of the viral, Darwinian nature of ideas. Like wildflowers and gypsy moths, they spread, they die out.</p>

<p>But everyone knows that. That&#039;s an <em>insanely boring</em> thing to have to be reminded of every time.</p>

<p>What&#039;s worse, it&#039;s just a metaphor. The world of human thought and behavior doesn&#039;t really work that way.</p>

<p>Think of how we always have metaphors for how the Universe works. It&#039;s a clock, it&#039;s a billiard table; God does or does not roll dice. None of those are true, they&#039;re just metaphors.</p>

<p>I don&#039;t have any hope that my complaint will catch on, but I have to try.</p>

<p>Cats must think of us the way we think of elephants: huge and gentle, but imperfectly aware of where our feet are.</p>

<p>As much as I dislike the word "meme," I triply hate the word "memetics." Ugh.</p>

<p>The automatic reaction of every liberal intellectual -- and I&#039;m one of those -- is to say, with some self-righteousness, that a situation is more complex than other people think it is.</p>

<p>I do this all the time; I know all about it.</p>

<p>But, to be scientific, we have to allow for the possibility that a situation is exactly as complex as other people say it is.</p>

<p>Or, which happens sometimes, allow that a situation may be <em>less</em> complex than other people say it is.</p>

<p>I&#039;m not making a statement about the situations of today. I don&#039;t know enough.</p>

<p>But we have to allow for the possibility of simplicity.</p>

<p>With all due respect to my co-worker John Robb, I have an intuition that the <a href="http://singularity.manilasites.com/">singularity</a> will mark the death of poetry and beauty.</p>

<p>Machine intelligence, intelligence without a human aesthetic sense, is... is I don&#039;t know what, beyond ugly, horrifying beyond sense. I resist it.</p>

<p>I&#039;m in a contrary mood.</p>

<p>The post-modern era ended the other day.</p>

<p>When something bad happens, ideologues always blame the people they always blame.</p>

<p>Falwell blames gays; liberals blame the CIA and our foreign policy leaders.</p>

<p>I don&#039;t see a difference between the two. It&#039;s the same thing. Both are irrational, gut reactions.</p>

<p>I&#039;m sick of dogma. Let&#039;s try to see reality.</p>

<p>John Donne:</p>

<p><blockquote>

No man is an <em>Iland</em>, intire of it selfe; every man is a peece of the <em>Continent</em>, a part of the <em>maine</em>; if a <em>Clod</em> bee washed away by the <em>Sea</em>, <em>Europe</em> is the lesse, as well as if a <em>Promontorie</em> were, as well as if a <em>Mannor</em> of thy <em>friends</em> or of <em>thine owne</em> were; any mans <em>death</em> diminishes <em>me</em>, because I am involed in <em>Mankinde</em>; And therefore never send to know for whom the <em>bell</em> tolls; It tolls for <em>thee</em>.

</blockquote></p>

<p>Another thing I don&#039;t like about the word "meme" is the look of it -- me-me -- and the <em>sound</em> of it. It sounds so infantile, a word made up by children in diapers.</p>
