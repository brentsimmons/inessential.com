<p>On Sunday Sheila and I got a new kitten.</p>

<p>He&#039;s sleeping on my lap as I type at my computer. Sometimes he wakes up and looks at me with his sleepy, trusting eyes. My heart moves around in my chest.</p>

<p>Today I wonder if the people who did this thing have ever had that, a kitten who trusts them with everything. If so, how could they still be monsters?</p>

<p>Well, sure, probably they did have a kitten. I always knew that. I&#039;m not naive. They have children too, some of them, I&#039;m sure. Still they&#039;re monsters.</p>

<p>I wish I could be naive. You couldn&#039;t be naive last week, and you sure can&#039;t be naive this week, and next week will be the same.</p>

<p>What fierce power makes human hearts such foul lumps?</p>
