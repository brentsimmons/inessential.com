<p>After a week on the beach, I&#039;m convinced that man is the aquatic primate. </p>

<p>It felt good -- right down to my DNA -- to float in the water, ride the waves, rub salt water out of my eyes, squish my toes in the sand.</p>

<p>As I was floating on my back as the waves rolled in, lifting me gently up and down, I thought -- aah, something else is holding up all these pounds for a change. This is nice.</p>
