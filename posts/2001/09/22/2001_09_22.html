<p>Back to the vet again this morning with <a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/2001/09/17">Papa</a>. It&#039;s a rabies thing, the vet&#039;s gonna make it so he doesn&#039;t get rabies. Good.</p>

<p>Though, being an indoor cat, I&#039;m not sure where&#039;s he&#039;d get it from.</p>

<p>Me?</p>

<p>Well, better safe than sorry -- because I&#039;d sure hate to go mad with rabies, bite my cat, and pass it on.</p>
