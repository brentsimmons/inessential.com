<p>Of the great powers of history, America is the least imperial with the best ideals -- and a will to live up to those ideals.</p>

<p>One of the many great things about America is we&#039;re constantly looking at our ideals and asking ourselves where we&#039;re falling short. We always fall short. <em>But we try</em>. We improve, we get better -- we make mistakes, but we do so much good at the same time.</p>

<p>This is the nation of Jefferson and Hamilton, Lincoln and FDR. The Declaration of Independence is our moral framework, the Constitution our plan.</p>

<p>Even during wartime we can&#039;t stop thinking about where we fall short. And note that we haven&#039;t -- many people, the President included, have made a big point of saying that Arabs and Muslims in America are not the enemy. Hate crimes are not tolerated.</p>

<p>I used to live in France, and I remember the entrenched racism against Algerians which extended from the man in the street to the highest levels of government. (One official declared a 0% immigration policy while I was living there. Police in Paris shot and killed unarmed Algerians. The average Pierre I talked to would complain that Algerians are not Catholic and would dilute the French way of life. Etc.)</p>

<p>I wonder if any European nations in the same situation as we&#039;re in would do as much for Arabs and Muslims living there. I suspect not.</p>

<p>Some differences...</p>

<p>1. America is not an ethnicity: we&#039;re from everywhere. We&#039;re not American in the same way French people are French.</p>

<p>Our national identity is more a meta-identity. It says you can be who and what you want, worship how you want, say what you want, wear what you want, be the person you are -- as long as you respect everyone else&#039;s right to do the same.</p>

<p>2. As stated above, our tradition is to constantly examine where and how we fall short of our ideals, those truths that we hold to be self-evident, and then work to improve.</p>

<p>3. As Gertrude Stein pointed out almost 100 years ago, America is the oldest nation in the world, in the sense that we have the longest-running system of government. (Actually, I think we&#039;re second-oldest, but whatever.)</p>

<p>Our system is built on wisdom that&#039;s been too rare in the world, and has stood the test of time.</p>

<p>Our system is the direct descendant of the French Enlightenment. For that I say: thank you! Merci!</p>
