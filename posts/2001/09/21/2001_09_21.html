<p>If you&#039;ve watched the Dow or read the news, you know the American economy isn&#039;t doing so well right now.</p>

<p>Part of the problem is people aren&#039;t spending money so much, aren&#039;t buying things or going out to eat or going to the movies.</p>

<p>If you can afford it, you can help by spending some money. And maybe you deserve a little fun?</p>

<p>If you go out to eat, then your waiter or waitress gets a tip they wouldn&#039;t have otherwise, and then maybe that helps them. Know what I mean?</p>

<p>So here&#039;s a list of ways to spend money. Hopefully most of them are fun.</p>

<p>This morning I heard from an old and dear friend of mine who saw my name at <a href="http://www.classmates.com/">classmates.com</a>. What a great way to start the day.</p>

<p>Thank you Internet.</p>

<p><img src="/images/atom.gif" height="30" width="29" border="0" alt="" /></p>

<p>I&#039;m walking around like the hunchback of Notre Dame since my kitten discovered it&#039;s nice to sleep on the back of my neck. The things we do for love!</p>

<p>There are people, Americans, on the Web and elsewhere, who stop just barely short of saying that we deserve what happened to us.</p>

<p>This makes me so heartsick.</p>

<p>I&#039;m not talking just about Jerry Falwell -- some are liberals, some are conservatives, some are in the middle.</p>

<p>What happened to these people&#039;s hearts and minds that they&#039;d be like this?</p>

<p>I&#039;m not sure I want to know. To understand something like that is to understand a darkness that I don&#039;t want to get to know too well.</p>
