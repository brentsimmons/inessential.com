<p>We&#039;re taking our kitten to the vet today for his post-adoption checkup.</p>

<p>It&#039;s funny how these little errands in life all seem invested with extra meaning. Every good thing you do, every bit of order you add to the world, is a small but profound response to recent events.</p>

<p>And it feels good to concentrate on something else.</p>

<p>Later...</p>

<p>On the way to the vet we drove by a mosque. The people were all out front standing and sitting in chairs and waving to traffic. They had signs like "Islam = Peace."</p>

<p>Lots of people driving by honked and waved. We did too.</p>

<p>How to tell you&#039;re a geek... When you type Islam == Peace at first, then remember that it was just a single = sign.</p>

<p>And still the single = seems wrong to you.</p>

<p>Which reminds me of one day a few years ago hanging out with UserLand employees Bob Bierman and Doug Baron. We were talking about how easily, or not easily, we tan in the sun.</p>

<p>Doug mentioned that he sometimes uses SPF 16 and sometimes SPF 32.</p>

<p>Which of course don&#039;t exist -- those are powers of two. We laughed.</p>

<p>I keep trying to think of jokes. Not about the events, but just jokes, because humor is good, right?</p>

<p>But it&#039;s hard.</p>

<p>In my brain I start out like this...</p>

<p>"Two men walk into a bar."</p>

<p>Okay, then what? Two men, so what?</p>

<p>"Two men walk into a bar, sit at the counter, and order beers."</p>

<p>"Then they start crying."</p>

<p>Okay, that&#039;s not working. Let&#039;s start over.</p>

<p>"Three men -- a WASP, a Jew, and an Arab -- are stranded on a desert island."</p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p>"They start crying."</p>
