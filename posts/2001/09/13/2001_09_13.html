<p>I&#039;m sitting on the recliner in my living room, working on my iBook today. (Thanks to my Airport.)</p>

<p>My kitten keeps jumping afdfsdaf  pdsof on my keyboard, since the only movement in the room is the typing of my fingers.</p>

<p>CNN is on TV, of course. I&#039;m addicted to news of recovered survivors. The people doing the hard work of digging in that rubble are all deserving of medals.</p>

<p>Last night I heard an airplane overhead and I nearly stood and applauded.</p>

<p>It&#039;s possible that my step-brother is or was at the Pentagon helping to dig out. He lives just outside D.C., and was until a little while ago a firefighter and rescue worker. He even did rescue diving -- looking for survivors under water. Hats off to him.</p>

<p>In a gnarly coincidence, my step-brother&#039;s name is Brent.</p>

<p>He has a two-year-old son named Brent.</p>

<p>During my recent vacation back East all three Brents got together for the first time. We expected a giant flaming pentagram to arise from the Earth to swallow us all up. (But it didn&#039;t happen, I&#039;m pretty sure. Somewhat sure.)</p>

<p>Three Brents? It&#039;s just so unnatural, a heinous crime against good taste.</p>

<p>I&#039;m seven years older than my step-brother. I was always known as Big Brent.</p>

<p>But my step-brother grew up to be 6&#039;5" and 270 lbs. (Something like that. He&#039;s gigantic, a leviathan on two legs.)</p>

<p>So now I&#039;m Brent the Elder.</p>

<p>Or Uncle Brent.</p>

<p>Call me Uncle Brent.</p>

<p>Details make stories come alive.</p>

<p>I heard one guy talking about walking down 80 stories in tower two. He remembered seeing piles of <em>shoes</em> at every floor, as people got rid of their shoes to make it easier to walk. One imagines that many of these were high-heeled shoes.</p>

<p>Another detail -- I heard that the passengers on the flight that crashed into the Pennsylvania cornfield <em>voted</em> on whether or not to try to overpower the hijackers. They voted! Americans to the last.</p>

<p>Voting, it&#039;s like an instinct with us, even when the most horrible thing is going on, we stop to vote.</p>

<p>You can&#039;t kill democracy, you can only kill people.</p>

<p>Everyone, or almost everyone, is beautiful in their own way.</p>

<p>I like to think that had this happened in Rome, Italians would <em>not</em> have taken their shoes off, but still would have made it out okay. After all, it&#039;s important to look good, no matter what, right?</p>

<p><img src="/images/atom.gif" height="30" width="29" border="0" alt="" /></p>

<p>Is the moment we go from republic to empire?</p>

<p>That&#039;s the question that scares me.</p>

<p>Or, it&#039;s the question that <em>should</em> scare me, but right now I&#039;m too angry.</p>

<p>Do we seek peace, or do we seek Pax Americana?</p>

<p>My kitten lives in what Sheila calls his "safe happy kitty world."</p>

<p>He knows nothing. He just wants to play with his green yarn and curl up in the sun.</p>

<p>Sometimes in his sleep his legs twitch. He&#039;s dreaming of chasing mice. Maybe Sheila and I are there in his dreams too, chasing mice with him? I hope so.</p>
