<p>I managed to whittle down the <a href="http://editorial.inessential.com/member/signUp">signup form</a> for this site to the bare minimum -- just email address, name, password, and repeat password. It makes it easier for people to join.</p>

<p>The key to this was getting rid of the Hint Question and Hint Answer in the virgin signup form. (This was a Manila change we made yesterday.)</p>

<p>So here&#039;s what I did on this site to get that bare signup form:</p>

<p>1. Did a Restore Default on my Custom Prefs on the Advanced page.</p>

<p>2. Edited my Custom Prefs so that they are:</p>

<p><code>&lt;wizard>&lt;panel title="Preferences">&lt;description/>&lt;/panel>&lt;/wizard></code></p>

<p>3. Clicked the Submit button.</p>

<p>Normally I try to pretend that Microsoft doesn&#039;t exist, less out of any sense of justice but more because they&#039;re boring and I don&#039;t like their software.</p>

<p>But with yesterday&#039;s news I couldn&#039;t help it. So I rented <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0218817">AntiTrust</a> last night. It was a fun fairy tale, an enjoyable bit of Open Source propaganda.</p>

<p>Go Milo!</p>

<p>Now I&#039;ll go back to pretending Microsoft doesn&#039;t exist.</p>
