<p>I added a couple little graphics I can use, just for jazz.</p>

<p>Tip: next time you boot Mac OS X, hold down the v key. You&#039;ll get to see what&#039;s actually happening as the OS boots. To a geek like me it&#039;s interesting.</p>

<p><strong>"Strategery"</strong></p>

<p>I didn&#039;t vote for Bush -- but I respect him and the office of the Presidency. When Bush says he&#039;s a uniter, I take him at his word.</p>

<p>I&#039;m willing to call the Ashcroft nomination an honest mistake.</p>

<p>But, as one of his first actions as President, Bush <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/01/22/MN96633.DTL">re-instated the gag rule</a>. He couldn&#039;t have done something more divisive.</p>

<p>To the millions of Americans like me hoping he&#039;ll live up to his word, this is a very bad sign.</p>

<p>My advice to Bush: spend your political capital wisely. You don&#039;t have as much as most incoming presidents. Save it for the big things, save it for your education program.</p>

<p>Look at it this way: you&#039;re starting with 100 bucks. You just threw 5 bucks into the Potomac.
