<p>Happy <a href="http://www.thekingcenter.org/">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> day!</p>

<p>One of the measures of patriotism is how forcefully and relentlessly one insists that we live up to our most noble ideals.</p>

<p>I wish I had shared a planet with him for more than 9 days. But I&#039;m pleased to live in the nation that he helped create.</p>

<p>The invention of America never ceases. In a very real sense I consider King one of our Founding Fathers.</p>

<p>There&#039;s more work to do: King&#039;s mission is not finished.</p>

<p>On a Mac OS X mailing list I subscribe to, there has been controversy about whether Apple should include Terminal.app -- which exposes the command-line interface -- in the final release of OS X.</p>

<p>The fear expressed by some is that Terminal.app is an invitation to developer laziness. If it&#039;s there, some say, developers will skip doing GUIs and regular Mac users will be forced to use the command line.</p>

<p>That&#039;s fear talking. Any developer that wants to make any money will do a GUI, and developers want to make money. So enough of that.</p>

<p>But here&#039;s where it gets hilarious. Some people are arguing that <em>AppleScript</em> is a command-line interface. In other words, they&#039;re saying Macs already have a CLI that quote-unquote normal users are used to using.</p>

<p>Hello? Is this thing on?</p>

<p>(By "thing" I mean "the brains of these people.")</p>

<p>So that argument comes from some of the oui-à-Terminal.app people.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s another hilarious argument from the other side, the non-à-Terminal.app folks -- they say that GUIs are <em>always</em> easier and quicker to use, in <em>every</em> context.</p>

<p>A counter-example: I find it 10x easier to type "ping foo.com" into a terminal window than to do the same thing in NetProbe. (NetProbe is a GUI app sort of like MacTCP Watcher -- it provides an interface for ping, whois, traceroute, DNS lookups, etc.)</p>

<p>If you&#039;re the kind of user who needs to run a traceroute now and again, you&#039;re probably the kind of user who can handle typing "traceroute foo.com." You&#039;re also probably the kind of user who will find it easier and quicker than reaching for the mouse and doing the GUI thing just to run a damn traceroute. I mean, <em>please</em>.</p>

<p>OS X is a huge cultural change. It&#039;s interesting to see how people adapt to it. Passionate arguments, and sometimes stupid arguments, appear to be part of the evolutionary (or revolutionary) process.</p>

<p>But I&#039;m like: go for it. It&#039;s a display of humanity. It&#039;s cool.</p>
