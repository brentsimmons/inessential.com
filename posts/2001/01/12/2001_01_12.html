<p>As a system admin for a free service, I sometimes get email (sent to the webmaster account) that could be charitably described as raunchy.</p>

<p>Some people think that the great thing about email is that you can write and send the filthiest abuse you can think of to complete strangers. It&#039;s fun and cost-free (cost-free in many senses of the word).</p>

<p>Such mail never comes from people I&#039;ve heard of, and it always comes from one of the free email services.</p>

<p>My sensibilities aren&#039;t so tender that the language actually offends me. (Were these messages better written and had some character development and perhaps a little plot -- and were the protagonist someone other than me -- they might be titillating. Okay, I&#039;m joking, but you get the point.)</p>

<p>What is offensive is just the sheer meanness behind it. What kind of person gets a kick out of this? Someone who doesn&#039;t see other people as human. Or who does but has contempt for humans.</p>

<p>As these messages are violations of the Terms of Service of their free email service, I report them.</p>

<p>As I do it, I say to myself that I&#039;m removing some bad genes from the gene pool.</p>

<p>It&#039;s not true, all I&#039;ve done is mildly inconvenienced somebody. But I keep my fingers crossed that the person will have learned that behavior on the Internet has consequences, and that words are actions.</p>

<p>My guess is that the person hasn&#039;t learned that lesson about home or school or work or whatever.</p>

<p>Well, small person, you&#039;re on my turf now.</p>

<p>Dude, nurses kick ass.</p>
