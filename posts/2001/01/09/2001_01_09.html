<p>I watched the Jobs keynote from MacWorld (via QuickTime). First my notes, then my <a href="http://inessential.com/#commentary">commentary</a>.</p>

<p>***Mac OS X</p>

<p>In stores March 24 for $129. Pre-loaded on Apple hardware in the Summer.</p>

<p>New features:</p>

<p>The Apple menu is back. It includes commands for Sleep, Restart, Shutdown, and Log Out. It has a Recent Items hierarchical menu, menus for Locations and prefs. It&#039;s in the upper-left corner where it should be -- no more non-functional Apple logo in the middle of the menubar.</p>

<p>Finder toolbars are smaller and very customizable.</p>

<p>You can make the Finder very like the OS 9 Finder if you prefer.</p>

<p>You can put folders in the dock, and a hierarchical menu pops up. It&#039;s a replacement for pop-up folders in OS 9.</p>

<p>Jobs didn&#039;t talk about it, but it appeared that the menubar clock is back -- and in the upper-right corner where a Mac user expects it</p>

<p>***New G4s</p>

<p>733 Mhz.</p>

<p>CD-RW. Drag-and-drop interface for burning CDs -- it&#039;s just a Finder operation. Drag files and folders to the CD.</p>

<p>4 new models, from 466 Mhz to 733 Mhz. Available in February.</p>

<p>***Digital Lifestyle</p>

<p>Jobs: PC is on the verge of entering it&#039;s 3rd golden age. (First two golden ages: Productivity and the Internet.)</p>

<p>Cameras, PDAs, phones, etc.</p>

<p>"The Mac can become the hub of our emerging digital lifestyle."</p>

<p>"Apple&#039;s unique strength."</p>

<p>***iTunes</p>

<p>MP3 ripper. Playlists. Burn custom playlists onto CD, play anywhere there&#039;s a CD player.</p>

<p>320 million CD-R disks sold in US in 2000.</p>

<p>Real JukeBox, Microsoft Media Player, etc. "too complex" and "have restrictions."</p>

<p>Introducing... iTunes.</p>

<p>Pulls in track info from Internet. Rips at 8.5 times regular speed. Sort by album, artist, song.</p>

<p>Searching as you type.</p>

<p>Drag-and-drop export to portable MP3 player.</p>

<p>Internet radio stations.</p>

<p>App can be "minituarized" so it doesn&#039;t have a huge window when you&#039;re doing other things.</p>

<p>Psychedelic music visualization thing which I can&#039;t explain.</p>

<p>Runs on OS 9. It&#039;s free. Available right now -- download from apple.com.</p>

<p>***iDVD</p>

<p>Make your own DVDs and play them in regular DVD players.</p>

<p>New RW drive in G4s can burn DVDs.</p>

<p>iDVD.</p>

<p>App helps with layout of content, buttons, etc.</p>

<p>1 inch thick. 5.3 pounds.</p>

<p>Made out of titanium. "Like the spy planes." Stronger than steel; lighter than aluminum.</p>

<p>2 models. $2599 and $3499. Available end of January.</p>

<p>Thinner than the VAIO sub-notebook.</p>

<p>***<a name="commentary">Commentary</a></p>

<p>Disclaimer: I own stock in Apple.</p>

<p>I don&#039;t personally care about iTunes or iDVD that much. They look good in demos, but it&#039;s unlikely I&#039;ll use them. Only because I don&#039;t care that much about the problems they solve.</p>

<p>About the new Titanium G4 -- I want one very badly. Wow. Thin and light and with a screen larger than my iBook. Yes, these are cool. I&#039;m drooling, oh yeah, yes sir.</p>

<p>Getting faster G4s with CD-RW is a big deal. I want more speed, and I definitely want to be able to archive to CD, as I can on my Windows machine.</p>

<p>The big deal for me is OS X news.</p>

<p>All I&#039;ve wanted is a UNIX-ish OS with a desktop that is:</p>

<p>1. Easy to use.</p>

<p>2. Customizable and powerful.</p>

<p>3. Visually appealing.</p>

<p>OS 9 is a good desktop -- it&#039;s all three of the above. But under the hood is where it fails.</p>

<p>OS X Public Beta is great under the hood, but the desktop isn&#039;t that great. (Compared to OS 9, anyway. I prefer it to some other desktops.)</p>

<p>GNOME and KDE are not that good. Yet, anyway. Even though under the hood they&#039;ve got Linux.</p>

<p>But the changes coming to OS X <em>do</em>, finally, appear to give me what I want. The Apple menu is important. Hierarchic folder menus in the Dock are important. The menubar clock is important. The ability to customize the Finder is important.</p>

<p>It&#039;s unclear whether they&#039;ve done anything about the anti-aliasing and transparency problems -- but I wouldn&#039;t be surprised, given the progress shown, if some of these things are customizable too. It&#039;s clear that they&#039;ve been listening to feedback.</p>

<p>Tentatively I will say that OS X is indeed what I have been waiting for, and it will replace OS 9 as my primary OS. This has been a big question for me, and the demo went as far as a demo can in answering that question.</p>

<p>I still need to see it and use it, of course.</p>

<p><a href="http://searchrequests.weblogs.com/">Disturbing Search Requests</a> was written up on page 10 of the February 2001 Linux Journal. They got half a page. Very cool.</p>

<p>Per Murphy&#039;s dictate they got the URL wrong in the article -- they had it as http://www.searchrequests.weblogs.com/. So, being the nice fella I am (or can be in rare moments) I installed a redirect so the incorrect URL will work.</p>
