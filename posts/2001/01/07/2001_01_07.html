<p>In the article <a href="http://www.freeos.com/articles/3109">Open Source is here to stay!</a> appears this line: "Open Source is one of those things that you either love or hate."</p>

<p>This isn&#039;t the first time you&#039;ve heard this about Open Source. You&#039;ve probably heard the same thing said about Microsoft, Apple, Java, OS X, and on and on.</p>

<p>I&#039;m just tired to death of that statement. I don&#039;t love or hate Open Source. Or whatever.</p>

<p>Note that it&#039;s almost always an advocate who writes such a statement.</p>

<p>It&#039;s as if Open Source, by polarizing people and igniting passions, is good <em>because</em> it inspires a strong emotional response. If it polarizes, it must be 100% good or 100% bad -- well, at least it&#039;s 100% <em>something</em>, right? Which elevates it over x, y, and z, right?</p>

<p>Once established that the topic is 100% something, the advocate now only needs a few paragraphs to establish that it&#039;s good. The arguments don&#039;t have to convince you that it&#039;s 100% good, because the 100% part has already been taken care of.</p>

<p>It&#039;s a crappy rhetorical device.</p>

<p>And it&#039;s a lie -- plenty of people don&#039;t love or hate Open Source. (Or whatever.)</p>

<p>Is there room for rational, curious, open-minded, and <em>adult</em> analysis of technologies and methods? We don&#039;t have to say that Open Source is all good or all bad when the truth is more complicated. Don&#039;t we have a moral obligation to refrain from false simplification?</p>

<p>inessential.com -- it&#039;s one of those weblogs that you love or hate, but nothing in between.</p>

<p>Just joking.</p>
