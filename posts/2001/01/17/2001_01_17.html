<p>I&#039;m going to have to disagree with my boss <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/01/17">about OS X</a>. Be would not have been a better choice. Or, not necessarily a better choice.</p>

<p>With Be, Apple would have had the same challenges: the Classic environment, so old apps would still run; Carbon APIs, so developers have a (relatively) easy path to port their existing apps; and user interface.</p>

<p>I don&#039;t know that it would have taken any less time with Be OS as a foundation. I suspect not.</p>

<p>Where they erred is not in their choice of OS (Be or NeXT) but in decisions regarding the desktop.</p>

<p>Were I running the show, I would have said right from the start that a functioning Apple menu is hugely important. Etc. Etc. There are tons of great things in OS 9 that I would have retained. The break was too severe, and they&#039;re working to fix that now. The break should never have been so sharp.</p>

<p>(Back to my boss -- he&#039;s fond of pointing out discontinuities -- the break between OS 9 and OS X is an example. Unfortunately, I was an English major and can&#039;t follow the math. [Joking.])</p>

<p>I don&#039;t expect the March 24 ship date to slip. However, I do expect that OS X 1.0 will be best left to early adopters. And, come July, I would strongly recommend that Apple get off their high horse about their so-called single-OS-strategy and give people an option about which OS they want bundled with new machines.</p>

<p>At this point, the biggest issue facing OS X, given that it&#039;s a fact and it will ship, may be lack of software. Running Classic apps is painful. There&#039;s no good email app on OS X. There&#039;s no BBEdit, no Photoshop, no Dreamweaver, no Acrobat Reader, etc. Yet, anyway.</p>

<p>You might say -- well, at least you, Brent, have CodeWarrior for OS X, right? It&#039;s true, I do. Except that, with OS X Public Beta, I have to boot into OS 9 to be able to do check-outs and check-ins with our source control system. I expect that will be the case with 1.0, too. So there are all these barriers to getting work done.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s another little thing (I&#039;ve got a huge list of them) -- there doesn&#039;t appear to be a way to extend the Finder&#039;s contextual menus. In OS 9 I&#039;d written a few extensions which I actually use, which I rely on. (Yet another definition of a geek: one who doesn&#039;t mind breaking out a C compiler just to customize his or her desktop. OS X won&#039;t let me be a geek in that way. Correct me if I&#039;m wrong.)</p>
