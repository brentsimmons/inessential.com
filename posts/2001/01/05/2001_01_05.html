<p><a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/stories/storyReader$4512">Radio UserLand 7.0b34</a> is out. Among the bug fixes is one that has annoyed me for a long time -- on Windows 2000, when you click the Edit With Radio button, Radio actually comes to the front now rather than just flashing in the taskbar. AFT.</p>

<p>Mac users -- I need your help. I need a word processor. The last word processor I used regularly was Word 5 for Macintosh (in 1995). So it&#039;s been years; I&#039;m out of touch.</p>

<p>I tried Word 98, and didn&#039;t like it, so that&#039;s out. (See #3 below.)</p>

<p>What else is there?</p>

<p>Here are my requirements:</p>

<p>1. It should be actively maintained. That means no WordPerfect, sadly. An OS X port in progress is a bonus, though I don&#039;t need an OS X version now.</p>

<p>2. It should output to at least one format that Word 98 can read. (Unfortunate but necessary.) RTF would be fine.</p>

<p>3. When I freakin&#039; double-click on a freakin&#039; word, it should not freakin&#039; select the freakin&#039; space after the freakin&#039; word, it should just freakin&#039; select the freakin&#039; word it-freakin&#039;-self.</p>

<p>4. I need to be able to run a demo before I buy.</p>

<p>5. If it has a ton of toolbars and icons and stuff, I need to be able to turn them off. The closer I get to a plain blank window, the happier I&#039;ll be. Everything else distracts.</p>

<p>6. I need to be able to set the default font and font size for new documents.</p>

<p>7. I need to be able to save as plain text.</p>

<p>8. Scriptability is a bonus.</p>

<p>Suggestions? <a href="mailto:brent@userland.com">Send me email</a> or <a href="http://editorial.inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$1155?mode=day">reply to this message</a> in the discussion group. Thanks!</p>

<p><em>Update 2:30 PM:</em> The most common recommendation so far is Nisus Writer, followed by AppleWorks and FrameMaker. One person suggested that I could customize Word 98 to make it work the way I want it to. Another suggested a combo of BBEdit and Quark XPress.</p>

<p>What I&#039;m going to do: 1) download a demo of Nisus Writer and 2) try AppleWorks. Those are the contenders.</p>

<p><em>Update 3:24 PM:</em> It was suggested that I try BBEdit. My response was: "I&#039;m already a BBEdit user. It and Stuffit Expander are the only two apps with aliases on my desktop. BBEdit is the reason I&#039;ve been able to go the last 5 years without a word processor."</p>

<p>This is cool -- at the bottom of Paul Andrews&#039; <a href="http://www.unionrecord.com/biz/display.php?ID=1785">latest column</a> in the Union Record, there&#039;s a link to his <a href="http://paulandrews.manilasites.com/">weblog</a>.</p>

<p>Well, sort of cool -- it&#039;s not really a link, just the URL. And they spell it as "Web log" rather than "weblog." Oh well.</p>

<p>The Union Record website is a PHP site. PHP is cool, btw. But one thing I find funny about the site is that you can make any article appear in any section. (Not the fault of PHP.)</p>

<p>For instance, just by changing the URL, Paul Andrews&#039; column can appear in the Sports section.</p>

<p>http://www.unionrecord.com/sports/display.php?ID=1785</p>

<p>Probably only someone who works on content management systems would get a kick out of discovering minor glitches like this.</p>

<p>The first part of the path /sports/ or /biz/ or whatever controls the template. The ?ID=1785 part identifies an article. It&#039;s such a nice, simple system.</p>

<p>At long last, the <a href="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2001-01-05-001-04-NW-LF-KN
">Linux 2.4 kernel</a> has been released.</p>

<p>As part of some <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/stories/storyReader$4497">tests</a> I did yesterday, I installed Netscape 6. And you know what? I&#039;m still using it, on both Windows and Macintosh. I was surprised to find that I like it. So far I haven&#039;t run across many bugs, nothing more than very minor annoyances. (MSIE has its share of bugs, too.)</p>

<p>I&#039;m using the Modern theme. Netscape is prettier than MSIE. That counts for something, indeed it does, because it&#039;s important not to get depressed by the drab flat grayness of MSIE.
