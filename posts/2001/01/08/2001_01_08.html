<p>In an <a href="http://www.artificialcheese.com/articles/january01/linuxppc/">article</a> speculating about Mac users dumping LinuxPPC for Mac OS X (or not doing so), an important point was missed -- lots of Macs won&#039;t be able to run OS X.</p>

<p>I have two working Macs that won&#039;t run OS X. One is running OS 8.x, the other is running LinuxPPC.</p>

<p>For many Mac users already running LinuxPPC, OS X is not even an option.</p>

<p>Which is sort of too bad. I say "sort of" because LinuxPPC is pretty cool. My advice, if you have an older Mac and you want to run a static server, install LinuxPPC on it. Don&#039;t bother installing a desktop, you don&#039;t need it. Install Apache. You&#039;ll be pleasantly surprised at how fast and stable it is.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.xappeal.org/">X Appeal</a> mentions some OS X rumors. These are just rumors. I hope they&#039;re true, but I have no idea.</p>

<p>"First up is that late builds of OS X allow you to move the Dock to any side of the screen and vertically. Additionally, even later builds have a.... Apple menu!"</p>

<p>OS X Hints has an article on <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20010105010922535">turning on SSH on your OS X machine</a>. Important info.</p>

<p>Sometimes when I read "XML-RPC" I hear Cartman&#039;s voice in my head. "Ecks-emmer Eh-pee-cee," he says. "Sweet," he says. God knows why I hear this.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, right, I forgot, it&#039;s because I&#039;m a total freakin&#039; geek. I&#039;ll try to remember.</p>
