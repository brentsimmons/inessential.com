<p>Isn&#039;t <a href="http://www.pbs.org/jazz/">Jazz</a> the official music of over-privileged, over-educated, straight white boys?</p>

<p>Oh, wait, I&#039;m one of those.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.trenchant.org/rants/51.html">Organizine closes after one week</a>. "But I just don&#039;t want to be responsible for hundreds of users&#039; content, and supporting and maintaining a web application. It&#039;s too much responsibility that I don&#039;t want."</p>

<p>No schadenfreude here -- I can totally relate. Were I a 20 year old in school there&#039;s no way I&#039;d want the responsibility either. It&#039;s not to be underestimated.</p>

<p>One of the worst things to deal with as a server admin is amateur crawlers.</p>

<p>Inktomi and Google and all can be bad when they go nuts all at once, as they sometimes do -- but that&#039;s not the worst of it.</p>

<p>People sometimes use WebWhacker-like software to download a whole site. That&#039;s not bad if the software is well-behaved. But not all such software is. And then you get n people doing it at the same time.</p>

<p>Worse than that... sometimes people use software they&#039;ve written themselves, or is in beta, or is just plain <em>terribly awfully sucky</em>, and it goes nuts in a huge smelly way. The symptoms of this are usually when just a few pages are requested very rapidly and repeatedly for several hours or a few days. You know then that somebody&#039;s POS crawler has gotten seriously stuck.</p>

<p>I&#039;m a couple days late, but I just can&#039;t resist commenting on Simson Garfinkel&#039;s article <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/col/garf/2001/01/08/bad_java/index.html?CP=RDF&DN=310">Java: Slow, ugly and irrelevant</a>.</p>

<p>It&#039;s not like Garfinkel is wrong -- writing applets and desktop apps in Java is contra-indicated. Agreed. <em>This is not news.</em> (Cocoa apps in Java may be an exception, but then they&#039;re not WORA.)</p>

<p>Garfinkel totally didn&#039;t mention Java on the server, where it <em>does</em> make sense. I just wanted to shake him and say, "Hello! Servlets!"</p>

<p>I prefer Frontier to servlets. But if I imagine an alternate universe, one in which there is no Frontier, I&#039;d be writing servlets right now, for many of the same reasons I like Frontier in the real universe.</p>

<p>(In fact, before I started working for UserLand, I was getting into server-side Java, having discovered that writing plug-ins in C for WebSTAR was limiting. This was in like 1996/1997. I had two plug-ins for sale: one of them sold one copy. Okay, maybe I wasn&#039;t the best marketer, but still. The Servlet API didn&#039;t exist yet, but it was clear it was coming. So I wrote server-side Java apps to this weird API the Roaster guys came up with. Ah, Roaster, a cool IDE. RIP. I hope you&#039;re up in software heaven hanging out with Think C. Say hi to HyperCard if you see him. I&#039;m rambling.)</p>

<p>Here&#039;s a little-known fact. In fact, I may be the only person who knows it. The filemakerLib scripts in Frontier were originally part of a set -- I did the Frontier version first, and I was working on the Java version, way back when, but then <a href="http://www.blueworld.com/blueworld/default.html">other</a> <a href="http://www.pervasive.com/">folks</a> came out with ways to access FileMaker from Java before I did, so I dropped the Java version.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s <a href="http://barista.editthispage.com/2001/01/08">Josh Lucas</a> and <a href="http://thauvin.manilasites.com/2001/01/10#ILoveJava">Erik Thauvin</a> on Garfinkel&#039;s article. </p>

<p><a href="http://editorial.inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$1171?mode=day">Joe Mahoney</a>: "It&#039;s not even worth the effort of rebutting."</p>

<p>Oui d&#039;accord, I think we&#039;ve been baited.</p>

<p>Why is text selection so brain-damaged in MSIE 5.5 for Windows? I&#039;m gonna, like, hurl.</p>

<p><a href="http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/2001/01/09">Daniel Berlinger</a>, writing about my comments of yesterday, writes: "How uncontrarian!"</p>

<p>Naturally I have no choice but to differ sharply with that statement.</p>
