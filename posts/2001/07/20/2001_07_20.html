<p>Maggie Davis and Melissa Simmons, my mother and sister, both worked for AdvanceOnline -- which, sadly, just shut down.</p>

<p>Now they&#039;re looking for new work.</p>

<p>Maggie Davis is a software developer; she managed the development team at AdvanceOnline. She has a master&#039;s degree in computer science and decades of programming experience. Her most recent experience is developing Web-based content management systems with Cold Fusion, SQL databases, JavaScript, and XML. Here&#039;s her <a href="http://www.inessential.com/mjdavis/stories/storyReader$4">resumŽ</a>.</p>

<p>Melissa&#039;s resumŽ is not online yet -- but let me tell you about her. She has a master&#039;s in economics, and was a project manager at AdvanceOnline. She has experience teaching at the college level, designing Web-based instructional material, and managing developers. Here&#039;s her <a href="http://www.inessential.com/melissa/">Manila site</a>. To contact her, send email to melissa&#64;ranchero.com.</p>

<p>I know times are tough -- but you still want the very best people. Maggie and Melissa are both in that top 1% -- good managers, conscientious and hard-working, and exceptionally bright and talented.</p>

<p>Remember how at the MacWorld keynote Jobs talked about an alternate minimize effect? Instead of the genie, it would just scale down -- which is faster.</p>

<p>Well, you can have that right now, actually. <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20010324091350279">Here&#039;s how</a>.</p>
