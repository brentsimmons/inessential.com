<p>We&#039;ve had such great weather. Until today.</p>

<p>If I were writing a book about Seattle weather, I might call it a <em>A New Refutation of Daylight</em> or <em>A Critique of Warmth</em>.</p>

<p>On the other hand it&#039;s cozy.</p>

<p>NY Times reviews <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/15/books/review/15MENDELT.html">The Strength of Poetry</a>, Oxford lectures by James Fenton.</p>

<p><blockquote>Fenton is skeptical of the &#039;&#039;handy teleologies&#039;&#039; of much recent criticism, in which poems are seen as the product of large historical forces rather than the personal idiosyncrasies of poets.</blockquote></p>

<p>Also:</p>

<p><blockquote>

&#039;&#039;There is no such thing as the artistic personality,&#039;&#039; Fenton says in his opening pages, &#039;&#039;not in poetry, not in the visual arts.&#039;&#039; His theme throughout the book is the way in which art is inseparable from personal uniqueness.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/crosscurrents/cc2001-01-24.htm">Sven Birkerts on Raymond Carver</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote>The ground, the cultural soil -- that element that our writers represent and from which they draw -- has been completely spaded up and turned since Carver&#039;s day. The writer who now picks up his pen -- or, as is more likely, turns on his laptop -- tunes in to a very different frequency. Understatement, once very nearly reflexive, sounds suddenly wrong. The held-back sentence looks almost funny on the page; there is a perceptible pressure to open out, annex, pull some of that overwhelming ambient complexity into the circuitry of the sentence.</blockquote></p>

<p>Something about Birkerts&#039; position doesn&#039;t seem right to me. Or maybe it&#039;s that I can&#039;t deal with the <em>loss</em>.</p>

<p>Either way, I don&#039;t believe, definitely not, that the anti-lyrical styles of Carver and Hemingway and so on are invalid even in the days of cell phones and the Internet.</p>

<p>I wish I could explain why, because Birkerts makes good points.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of <a href="http://wildcat.arizona.edu/papers/92/101/01_1_m.html">social spiders</a>? I just learned about them only a week ago, and I&#039;ve been scared ever since.</p>

<p>Most spiders are total loners, right? Not these guys -- hundreds or thousands of them will band together and form hugely giant webs and prey on creatures solitary spiders could never catch alone.</p>

<p><em>Scary</em>.</p>

<p>And, I can&#039;t help thinking -- what a great band name. Or domain name -- socialspiders.com isn&#039;t taken. Hop to it.</p>

<p>Are webloggers social spiders?</p>
