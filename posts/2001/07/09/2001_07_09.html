<p>Just last night Sheila and I were going to order from WebVan. But their servers weren&#039;t responding. So I looked around for news about WebVan and couldn&#039;t find any.</p>

<p>And then this morning I see they&#039;ve ceased to be, they&#039;re an ex-dotcom.</p>

<p>Super-bummer.</p>

<p>I have a theory about why they&#039;re gone. It&#039;s that Americans, no matter what they say, are cheapskates and penny-pinchers. They always go for the lowest prices.</p>

<p>This is why Walmart wins over all the smaller chains and mom-and-pop shops. This is why giant suburban outlet malls suck the life out of downtowns and Main Streets.</p>

<p>This is why corporations move their jobs out of the U.S., to where labor is cheaper -- because you have to compete on price.</p>

<p>Nothing else matters. People will drive farther, shop in an ugly crowded environment -- they&#039;ll do whatever it takes to shave a nickel off the price of baked beans, or two-fifty off the price of Air Jordans, or whatever.</p>

<p>So WebVan was a little more expensive. For the convenience of it I would expect so. I didn&#039;t mind paying the extra -- it was a wonderful service, and I was a regular customer.</p>

<p>Now, I know that some people have to shave pennies. I was very poor for many years myself. I know how to do it; I know all about it.</p>

<p>But the majority of Americans don&#039;t have to be so cheap.</p>

<p>It&#039;s almost like a moral thing. If you don&#039;t go for the best deal, there&#039;s something wrong with you.</p>

<p>And so what hope is there to end sweatshops, habitat destruction, chain-store homogenization, etc. etc.? None. None at all. It all comes down to the sickness of consumer demand for... Everyday Low Prices!</p>

<p>And so, you know what, I&#039;m bugged. Now I actually have to spend time at the grocery store. I don&#039;t like it. It takes time. It&#039;s boring. People there act like oblivious idiots. I like to ram them with my cart.</p>

<p>The store is always out of stuff. How come I can&#039;t get dill pickle spears, they always have to be halves or minis? Everyone knows spears are best.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.calumr.btinternet.co.uk/">GUIdo</a> generates user interfaces from XML files. It allows one to create GUIs for command-line tasks on OS X.</p>

<p>I doubt that I&#039;ll actually use it -- since I&#039;m okay with the command line, myself -- but I&#039;m a fan of generating interfaces from XML.</p>

<p>One of my favorite Simpsons jokes is this.</p>

<p>An old lady at the grocery store is getting her groceries bagged. The bag boy has put them in about five bags -- there&#039;s lots of groceries.</p>

<p>So she says -- start over! Put them all in one bag. And don&#039;t make that bag too heavy!</p>

<p>Last week there was a lot of talk about air rage and bad service on the airlines. Well, people may complain about service, bad food or no food, lost bags, etc. -- but the airlines know damn well that when it comes to buying tickets, <em>which is all that matters</em>, the lowest price wins.</p>

<p>The airlines can&#039;t afford things like good service, because we won&#039;t pay for it.</p>

<p>Sorry.</p>

<p>I would say <em>get a clue</em>, but you&#039;d go get a shoddy clue, poorly crafted, made by prison labor with sub-standard materials -- just so you can save a buck or two. So I won&#039;t say it, since it&#039;s pointless.</p>
