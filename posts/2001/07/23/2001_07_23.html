<p>Some random book recommendations...</p>

<p>I just finished two books over the weekend.</p>

<p><a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0671657151">The Closing of the American Mind</a> by Allan Bloom was a surprise best-seller in the &#039;80s. The thesis is that the university is not supposed to be relevant, it&#039;s not supposed to be subjected to the whims of postmodernism, historicity, and radical politics -- it should be an arena of true academic freedom, where literature and philosophy are actually read and taught and discussed rather than deconstructed or taught merely as a type of history.</p>

<p>At first glance, this thesis may sound reactionary, as if it&#039;s just another smart guy who&#039;s found yet another way to belittle the interests of minorities. But the book is anything but that -- it&#039;s more truly radical than just about anything I&#039;ve ever read.</p>

<p>It&#039;s not an easy read -- there&#039;s a lot about Socrates, Heidegger, Freud, Rousseau, and the &#039;60s in there. But for the thinking reader, the book has the power to profoundly influence <em>how</em> one thinks. Read it.</p>

<p>Much shorter and more fun is <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=1573440027">Susie Bright&#039;s Sexwise</a>, subtitled "America&#039;s Favorite X-Rated Intellectual Does Dan Quayle, Catharine MacKinnon, Stephen King, Camille Paglia, Nicholson Baker, Madonna, the Black Panthers and the GOP."</p>

<p>It&#039;s a collection of short essays, written in Bright&#039;s charming and direct voice. In true pragmatic American fashion, the erotic imagination is for Bright not just type of art or, well, a turn-on -- it&#039;s a means to power. The prescription is not to wear low-cut blouses and thereby get men to do what you want -- it&#039;s to <em>take charge of one&#039;s erotic life</em>. Bright says that even in this day and age, even with the feminist and sexual revolutions, women are still denied this male prerogative. Not completely, not 100%, but there&#039;s still so far to go.</p>

<p>I especially enjoyed when she rips into anti-porn queens Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon. MacKinnon helped craft a Canadian law that banned importing literature that&#039;s "degrading to women" -- pornography, essentially. The irony is that a book by Dworkin, MacKinnon&#039;s anti-porn comrade-in-arms, was denied entry into Canada as a result of this law. Poetic justice.</p>

<p>Last night I started <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0375726837">Experience</a> by Martin Amis, a memoir. I&#039;m only a couple dozen pages into it, so there isn&#039;t much to say yet -- except that, as always, reading Amis&#039; prose is a total joy. For sheer surface pleasure there are few writers to recommend over Amis.</p>

<p>In Amis&#039; hands, English isn&#039;t just a language anymore, it&#039;s a drug, it&#039;s cocaine, it goes straight to the brain&#039;s pleasure center and applies direct current.</p>
