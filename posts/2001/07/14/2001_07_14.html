<p>I retired a server last night. Woo-hoo! As a guy who runs or helps run about a dozen servers, this is a great thing.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s the life story of this server, a Mac 7200/120.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ranchero.com/">Ranchero&#039;s</a> original server was a Quadra 650, purchased at Future Shop on Aurora in 1995. It was originally at the end of a dedicated 28.8 modem, before being moved to <a href="http://www.forest.net/">digital.forest</a>, then in Redmond. (I think it was Redmond -- it was in the woods somewhere.)</p>

<p>Before going to digital.forest, for a few months it was in my bedroom -- and I&#039;d wake up at night when <a href="http://www.vl-brabant.be/mac/autoboot.html">AutoBoot</a> kicked in and restarted it after a crash. The Mac startup chimes would wake me up. Then <a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/">Sheila</a> would say: wake up, the baby&#039;s crying. She still teases me about it. (More proof how cool she is -- she put up with having a server in our bedroom. Sheesh.)</p>

<p>Anyway -- it wasn&#039;t long before we wanted a faster server, and so we bought the 7200/120 to replace it.</p>

<p>So -- back to Future Shop to get a 7200/120. In 1996 it was a pretty fast machine, though not the top-of-the-line, so it was a good deal.</p>

<p>We drove it out to digital.forest, and basically just copied the hard drive from the 650 to the 7200.</p>

<p>And now, four years later, it has been turned off. A real trooper, it performed well with few glitches for four years. Its services are now running on other machines.</p>

<p>Its name was <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0140059024">jeeves</a>. The original 650 was also named jeeves. Now it&#039;s the end of an era -- there is no more jeeves.</p>

<p>I&#039;m now running just one pre-OS-X Mac server, a G3 we bought in 1998 (I think). It&#039;s running some of jeeves&#039; services plus a few of its own. I&#039;m working toward retiring it too.</p>

<p>But I have and will continue to have a fondness for the old Macs. They&#039;re what I cut my teeth on -- and they did make pretty good servers. Security was <em>much</em> less of an issue than on NT or Linux or OS X. <a href="http://www.webstar.com/">WebSTAR</a>, <a href="http://www.eudora.com/eims/">EIMS</a>, <a href="http://www.menandmice.com/2000/2200_quick_dns.html">QuickDNS</a>, <a href="http://www.maxum.com/Rumpus/">Rumpus</a>, <a href="http://www.fogcity.com/lr_features.html">LetterRip</a>, etc. -- they&#039;re all so damn easy to maintain. If you&#039;re a Mac guy, and I was and still am, you had to appreciate the beauty of how even the server apps were Mac-like. So much attention to hacking the details.</p>

<p>The worst thing was, of course, that they didn&#039;t stay up as well as, say, Linux boxes. They crashed or froze. Even still, I sometimes got uptimes measured in months.</p>

<p>But then a server might go through a period where it wouldn&#039;t stay up for more than a day, as if Murphy was cradling it in his accident-prone embrace.</p>

<p>So that&#039;s a horrible way to live, and it&#039;s why you have to retire these great old machines and go with OS X, Linux, BSD, NT, something a bit more stable.</p>

<p>While I feel sentimental toward the machine, toward the history it represents for me -- it&#039;s a <em>huge</em> relief to turn it off. It&#039;s one less machine to crash on me.</p>

<p>But I couldn&#039;t let this pass -- nearly five years of service -- without a notice.</p>
