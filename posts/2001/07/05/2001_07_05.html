<p>After doing my list of cool American stuff yesterday, I was thinking about a list of not-cool things. And you know what? It would be <em>far</em> shorter than the list of cool things.</p>

<p>But anyway, I&#039;m not going to write that list. It doesn&#039;t interest me. It&#039;s more interesting to find the cool and beautiful things and bring attention to them. There&#039;s not enough of that.</p>
