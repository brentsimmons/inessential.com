<p>I&#039;m  the <a href="http://talkingmoose.manilasites.com/">Talking Moose</a>. I&#039;m <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0054331">Spartacus</a> too, by the way.</p>

<p>I long for an art that is not anti-rational; I long for a philosophy that is not anti-poetic. I&#039;d also like to see 8 hot dogs per package, and 8 hot dog buns per package, so it would match up. But no.</p>

<p>It always makes me laugh how people want to be crazy or extreme or different. They want to "express themselves" -- but they almost always choose the most totally boring and conventional and tasteless ways to be different -- extreme sports, drugs, tattoos and piercings, shopping at Urban Outfitters, rock climbing, bungee jumping.</p>

<p>Like, dude, <em>intense</em>.</p>

<p>It reminds me of what Nabokov wrote about Madame Bovary:</p>

<p><blockquote>
Her exotic daydreams do not prevent her from being small-town bourgeois at heart, clinging to conventional ideas or committing this or that conventional violation of the conventional, adultery being a most conventional way to rise above the conventional.
</blockquote></p>

<p>If one were to write about a modern-day Bovary, there would be no adultery in the story -- the novel&#039;s ending would be an account of a tragic death in a snowmobile-induced avalanche at Glacier National Park.</p>

<p>It was someone (Socrates?) who said the unexamined life is not worth living. I don&#039;t think he meant the unanalyzed life -- I think he meant this in a philosophical way rather than a psychological way. But anyway.</p>

<p>And someone else (Nietszche?) said that life without music would be just a big mistake.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s me: the un<em>imagined</em> life is not worth living.</p>

<p>It&#039;s a sad pointer to the poverty of imagination that people feel the need to risk their lives for thrills.</p>

<p>"But dude, I feel totally alive when I play Russian Roulette. You just don&#039;t get it."</p>

<p>And then I think of Darwin, and I laugh and laugh.
