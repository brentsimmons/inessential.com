<p>Sele threw a <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/134318616_mariners16.html">two-hit, complete game shutout</a> yesterday. Mariners are now <a href="http://scores.seattletimes.nwsource.com/default.asp?c=seatimes&page=mlb/stand/standingbba.htm">66-25</a>, 19 games ahead of the second-place A&#039;s.</p>

<p>These are just the facts; I make no predictions. (Why? Because this is <em>baseball</em>.)</p>

<p>Speaking of the national past-time, I highly recommend George Will&#039;s <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0060973722">Men at Work</a>, an unromantic, captivating look at the craft of baseball.</p>
