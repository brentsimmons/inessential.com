<p>I dream sci-fi.</p>

<p>Last night I dreamt I was on the Lunar colony, sitting in the big cafeteria eating lunch with Sheila and all the workers there. We&#039;re all wearing orange jumpsuits.</p>

<p>Then a moonquake hit.</p>

<p>Not a bad one, but enough to scare the hell out of everybody. Things were shaking. In my mind I pictured the air rushing out. I thought about blue Earth and how there&#039;s an atmosphere there. Then it was over.</p>

<p>Cut to... I&#039;m now in the office of the safety director, demanding to know what the safety procedures are in the case of a bad moonquake.</p>

<p>"I didn&#039;t even know there was such a thing!" she says.</p>

<p>Uh-oh.</p>

<p>"Well," she says, "we&#039;ll definitely come up with something."</p>

<p>And to think I had been considering signing up for one of the runs to Jupiter&#039;s moons. It turns out that people in space are about as bright as people on Earth. Nuts.</p>

<p>Of course, back in real life, I don&#039;t even know if there is such a thing as moonquakes. But then, I&#039;m not the safety director of the Lunar colony, am I.</p>

<p>When I was a kid back in the &#039;70s I thought for sure we&#039;d have a permanent station on the moon by now.</p>

<p>But instead we&#039;re struggling just to put up a space station.</p>

<p>I figured we&#039;d have <em>hotels</em> in Earth orbit by now. But no.</p>

<p>The thing is, the hell of it is, <em>we could have done it if we wanted to</em>. </p>

<p>I don&#039;t know why we didn&#039;t.</p>

<p>There&#039;s still time, brother.</p>

<p>I dream I&#039;m a sci-fi hero. I&#039;ve had this dream several times (though not last night).</p>

<p>I&#039;m the leader of three colony ships, the first ever to leave the Solar System. We&#039;re looking for habitable planets in nearby systems. We&#039;re looking for life.</p>

<p>It&#039;s not like Star Trek -- the ships are slow, and there&#039;s no evidence of life outside Earth.</p>

<p>So we&#039;ve just surveyed the nearby stars, a half-dozen systems -- Alpha Centauri and so on. We&#039;re all middle-aged now; the trip has taken years. We found nothing. Just childless suns shining for no reason, nurturing no one, warmth and light without purpose.</p>

<p>Another region of space further on has planets that may be Earth-like, our telescopes tell us. They&#039;re the right size at the right orbit around the right kind of star. Just like the planets we already went to.</p>

<p>If we go on, we&#039;ll be lucky to make it back to Earth before we&#039;re 90 years old. We&#039;ll be lucky to make it back to Earth at all. We could leave for Earth now and be home in a few years.</p>

<p>Should we go on? It&#039;s outside of our mission.</p>

<p>But I can order it.</p>

<p>It&#039;s so far, and space is so bleak. I think about my people for days as we orbit another clump of rock slowly turning in the vaccuum.</p>

<p>I look out at the black of space and into the black of my coffee cup.</p>

<p>Will we find anything out there, or just more cold, mute stone?</p>

<p>Finally I order it.</p>

<p>We go on.</p>

<p>The rockets burn simultaneously on the three ships and we are moving again. There the dream ends.</p>
