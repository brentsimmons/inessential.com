<p>Yesterday Sheila and I took a walk down to the <a href="http://www.nws.usace.army.mil/opdiv/lwsc/">Ballard locks</a>. If you live in Seattle, or are planning to visit, this is a great time to go there.</p>

<p>The salmon were jumping out of the water. The fish ladder was crowded with sockeye (I think) making their way upstream.</p>

<p>The locks themselves were busy with boats going into Lake Union.</p>

<p>Lots of people were there -- it was a sunny Sunday afternoon -- but even still it wasn&#039;t too crowded. Many people brought their dogs. We saw two collies, a <a href="http://www.akc.org/breeds/recbreeds/pug.cfm">pug</a>, and various mutts.</p>

<p>The gardens were lovely, with foxglove, rudbeckia, and lots of poppies. In the nursery, which is the first walkway on the right as you enter, we saw a <a href="http://mamba.bio.uci.edu/~pjbryant/biodiv/lepidopt/nymph/lorquin.htm">Lorquin&#039;s Admiral</a>.</p>

<p>And naturally there were squirrels, which I think followed us there.</p>

<p>Heard on the radio -- Dave Niehaus haiku:</p>

<p>Swung on and belted<br />

Deep to left-center field, it<br />

will fly, fly away</p>

<p>My Mom has an <a href="http://www.fanciers.com/breed-faqs/ocicat-faq.html">ocicat</a> named Spot. (Data&#039;s cat on Star Trek was named Spot.) </p>

<p>We&#039;re always amazed by how like a dog he is -- he even likes to play fetch with his cat toys. So just last night I read up about the ocicat -- and, sure enough, it&#039;s a characteristic of the breed.</p>

<p>From the page linked to above:</p>

<p>"It is a lot like a dog in that it is absolutely devoted to its people."</p>

<p>And: "They are extremely people-oriented, living well with children and people of all ages and types. They do not display an aloof temperament and actually act more like a dog than a cat." </p>

<p>And: "There are times when Ocis are fully capable of opening doors or cage latches, many others who in a &#039;dog-like&#039; manner will fetch, and the interesting case of an Ocicat who would sit and wave &#039;bye-bye&#039;."</p>
