<p>My sister <a href="http://www.inessential.com/Melissa/resume">Melissa now has her rŽsumŽ up</a>. Whoever hires her is damn lucky.</p>

<p>Sheila has been having <a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/2001/07/23">mass fun</a> with her new Wacom tablet.</p>

<p>I wonder what my rŽsumŽ would look like?</p>

<p>Luckily -- very very luckily -- it doesn&#039;t matter.</p>

<p>Which restaurants did I work in? Seattle-ites may recognize the names:</p>

<p>Trattoria Mitchelli<br />

A-Jay&#039;s<br />

McCormick and Schmick&#039;s<br />

Red Robin<br />

CafŽ Casino<br />

Chinook&#039;s<br /></p>

<p>Plus one day, just one, at the U District International House of Pancakes. (I just couldn&#039;t stand it.)</p>

<p>Being a busboy was a pretty good gig, at least at the better restaurants on the above list. I&#039;d work for several waiters, and they&#039;d all tip me a portion of their tips. So I went home with cash -- not quite as much as a single waiter, but pretty close.</p>

<p>And I didn&#039;t have the responsibilities of a waiter. No adding up the checks at the end of the shift. I refilled people&#039;s water and coffee and stuff -- but mostly the waiters dealt with the people. So it was a very physical job, running around, carrying trays and wiping down tables.</p>

<p>All emphasis was on speed. And I was damn good at it. But it made me sick after about ten years.</p>

<p>Jobs like that, it&#039;s the same thing every day, there&#039;s no such thing as accomplishment.</p>

<p>Every day people have to eat, and they make a mess, and that&#039;s it, and then there&#039;s tomorrow, same fish bones and half-empty glasses of wine and children&#039;s crayon scribblings on the table.</p>

<p>You have no idea how common it is for people to leave their doggy bag in the restaurant. I&#039;d almost say it was most of the time. People don&#039;t really want to take the food with them. It&#039;s a fiction.</p>

<p>The worst thing I ever saw -- and I saw this many times -- was a well-dressed man and a woman leaving their table, man first -- and then the woman grabs a few dollars from the tip lying there on the table and squirrels it away. Her petty grab is unseen by the man, who&#039;s invariably smiling and leading the way to the door. A good joe, prolly.</p>

<p>I&#039;d like to tell people like that that their heart is made of fish bones.</p>

<p>But what I would do is just clean up, and then some other people would sit there.</p>
