<p>Years ago I worked at Goodwill as a book pricer. I threw away books that were in bad shape, and priced the rest of them. (Most books were thrown away, unfortunately -- which was weird for a guy who never threw away a book before.)</p>

<p>Many books had little scraps of paper, photos, shopping lists, postcards, etc. in them. Sometimes I saved them.</p>

<p>I present a few now as found poetry. All the line breaks and spelling errors are original.</p>

Is it a matter of submitting to God,

   saying you will follow Him,

   even to the point of what seems

   to be a "good" source

   of action

 

Even you be saved and still

   be practicing

 

Will you submit to God,

   saying you will do whatever

   he asks even to the point

   of denying yourself

   the fulfillment of some basic needs.

   is this really what God wants.

 

Should a person put his full confidence

   on the Bible and trust it

   his life.

 

We must choose to obey

   submit to God --

   see God as one who

   who has a thought over us

   or can we reject God

   (do this by saying,

   I will follow my own wisdom first

   and do what seems right to me

   lawlessness)

   instead coming to God

   and asking what he thinks I should do

   become fools,

   following the world&#039;s wisdom--

   exchange a relationship

   under God which is life

   and freedom for earthly wisdom

 

they put the wisdom ahead

   of choosing to follow God

 

Ron Is H due to Judas&#039; rejection of God--

   or the culture--

   prevent rejections

 

Cultural rejection--(original sin)--

   disordered human sexuality in general

   must choose

   whether to obey or glorify God
