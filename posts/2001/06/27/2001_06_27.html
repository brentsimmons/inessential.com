<p>The <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/UNS/html4ever/980626.Turpin.fireflies.html">firefly</a> -- the lightning bug -- is actually a beetle. They&#039;re not found west of the Rockies, which is why I haven&#039;t seen any in Seattle. But I have fond memories of running around in the woods and catching them when I was a kid back east.</p>

<p>Lately I&#039;ve been getting spam for <em>breast</em> enlargement.</p>

<p>Which seems like there ought to be a great joke here, but I can&#039;t think of a good one. So here&#039;s a gratuitous link to <a href="http://www.dollywood.com/">Dollywood</a> and a link to <a href="http://www.planetpamela.com/">Planet Pamela</a>.</p>

<p>There&#039;s a magazine called <a href="http://www.bust.com/">Bust</a>. <a href="http://www.hooters.com/">Hooters</a> has a website.</p>

<p>Och, enough. Breasts are undoubtedly the most commercialized of body parts.</p>

<p>To paraphrase Voltaire -- if large breasts didn&#039;t exist, advertising agencies would have had to invent them. (In fact, given the number of surgeries per year, they practically did.)</p>

<p>Norman Mailer once wrote something to the effect that <a href="http://www.marilynmonroe.com/">bottle blondes</a> are more truly blonde than natural blondes -- since they&#039;re <a href="http://www.madonnafire.it/foto/1990/bat.htm">blonde by choice</a> rather than accident of genetics.</p>

<p>I&#039;m sure a similar observation could be made about <a href="http://www.4apc.net/headlights.html">headlights</a>.</p>
