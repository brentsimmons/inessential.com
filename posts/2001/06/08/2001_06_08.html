<p>Whenever something like Microsoft&#039;s <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/19557.html">Smart Tags</a> thing comes up, my first thought is to say: "Goodbye. Fuck you. I&#039;m going to go collect butterflies. Fuck you."</p>

<p>And then I remember that the Web is way too valuable to just give it away like that. Sometimes I wish that wasn&#039;t true, it would be so much easier.</p>

<p>I wonder if it&#039;s a syndrome, intelligent programmers so sickened by x, y, and z that they leave the industry completely.</p>

<p>If it seems like I take this stuff too personally, well, it is personal. For years the Web has been a real, constant presence, and I work on my corner of it day and night. The Web has done alot for me, and I try to do alot for the Web. I listen, as honestly and clearly as I can, to what it really wants; I try to hear over the din of shit. I&#039;m not saying I do it perfectly, but I do make the attempt as best I can.</p>
