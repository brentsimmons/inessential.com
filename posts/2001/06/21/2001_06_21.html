<p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/anchordesk/stories/story/0,10738,2778828,00.html?chkpt=zdhpnews02">Good-bye CueCat</a>. This should win an award for stupidest idea in the over-$200-million-wasted category.</p>

<p>The assumption behind the CueCat is that people really are no more than automatons, slaves to advertising and spoon-fed media. It gratifies me immensely to see it fail.</p>

<p>I mean, can you picture what was in those guys&#039; head? Joe User, sitting in front of his computer as he reads his favorite magazine, scanning ads and smiling like a moron as his Web browser takes him from one soul-killing Web site to another.</p>

<p>Dudes, I don&#039;t think so. Go to hell for thinking like that.</p>

<p>I added the no-smart-tags meta tag to this site.</p>

<p>It&#039;s easy. If you&#039;re a Manila user, edit your template (and home page template if you use it) and add this code in the &lt;head> section of your template:</p>

<p><code>&lt;meta name="MSSmartTagsPreventParsing" content="TRUE"></code></p>
