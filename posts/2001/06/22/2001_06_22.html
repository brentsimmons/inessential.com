<p>You know I like Mac OS X. The more I use it, the more I learn about it, the more I like it.</p>

<p>That said, today I&#039;m going to talk about the problems, in hopes that they will get fixed.</p>

<p>The biggest problem is user interface performance.</p>

<p>I had expected that OS X -- being entirely PowerPC native -- would run rings around OS 9. I expected the UI&#039;s performance to <em>blow away</em> everything I&#039;d seen before on a Mac (or even on Windows). But it&#039;s not so.</p>

<p>I suspect there are two things:</p>

<p>1. Functionality comes first, then optimization. Apple hasn&#039;t gotten to the optimization part yet.</p>

<p>2. OS X is written for computers that don&#039;t exist yet. This wouldn&#039;t be the first time. Remember how Netscape 2.0 seemed like a huge piece of bloatware? These days it seems thin and fast and light. Moore&#039;s law dictates OS X will get faster even without optimization.</p>

<p>But who wants to wait a year or two and shell out the bucks for a new computer?</p>

<p>***Performance problems that bug me</p>

<p>1. Live window re-sizing.</p>

<p>This is totally slow. It&#039;s not just the Finder, but any app that uses this feature. One of the reasons <a href="http://frontier-osx.userland.com/">Frontier for OS X</a> doesn&#039;t do live window re-sizing is that it&#039;s so slow. Why do the extra work for a negative benefit?</p>

<p>Live scrolling is often similarly slow. However, I&#039;ve seen some apps do it better than other apps, so this isn&#039;t necessarily a system problem, just something that&#039;s difficult to do well. (More difficult than it should be.)</p>

<p>2. Application launch times.</p>

<p>There are those who say it&#039;s not that OS X is slow, it&#039;s that users need to change their habits. The advice is to launch all your apps at startup and leave them running.</p>

<p>Bullshit.</p>

<p>I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m going to use in advance. And, furthermore, apps launch quite quickly on OS 9 and Windows.</p>

<p>I suspect the problem is that when apps launch they link to a bunch of shared libraries, and this is what takes so much time. So this is a system problem.</p>

<p>(I note with pride that Frontier launches more quickly than most other apps I use on OS X.)</p>

<p>3. Switching windows, switching apps.</p>

<p>I hate switching windows or apps. It seems like an Aqua thing -- I have plenty of memory, I don&#039;t hear the disk being hit -- it&#039;s just that redrawing the windows to be enabled/disabled appears to take time. I say it <em>seems</em> like a drawing thing, but I don&#039;t know for  sure.</p>

<p>4. Menus.</p>

<p>You click -- you wait -- ah, there&#039;s the menu. It&#039;s not usually a long wait, but just long enough to be noticeable. Again, it feels like a drawing thing, but I don&#039;t know for sure.</p>

<p>It&#039;s just so annoying -- heartbreaking, almost -- that when I switch to OS 9 or Windows (heaven forfend) after working in OS X I get a little shiver of joy as the UI is just so damn responsive in comparison.</p>

<p>***Other issues that bug me</p>

<p>1. Fuzziness.</p>

<p>On my Trinitron, Aqua is sharp and beautiful. Pleasant without being distracting.</p>

<p>On my iBook it&#039;s a bit fuzzy.</p>

<p>On my Samsung 770 LCD it&#039;s atrocious, unusable for more than a minute or two. (So the server gets that monitor.)</p>

<p>I fear that Apple&#039;s new 17" LCD monitor will have about the same quality as the iBook. Which is just not good enough. Aqua demands high-quality glass monitors -- just as, ironically, Apple is shifting to LCD monitors.</p>

<p>2. Screen real estate.</p>

<p>OS X takes up more space than OS 9. Fonts are larger. Everything is larger. Very little is customizable.</p>

<p>My 17" Trinitron is great for development on OS 9 -- but it&#039;s just too damn small on OS X. I use it, but I don&#039;t like it, it feels claustrophobic. But do I want to buy a new monitor? No way.</p>

<p>3. Missing pieces of developer documentation.</p>

<p>I was trying to find out how to write global OSA components for OS X. Couldn&#039;t find docs or sample code.</p>

<p>Other examples: how does one manipulate the icon in the dock? Or add to its menu? Or add a global menu? Or...</p>

<p>They&#039;re filling the holes, yes, and there are tons of docs, yes, but it seems that too often I still can&#039;t find what I&#039;m looking for. That makes development a bit of a challenge, to say the least.</p>

<p>4. MSIE is the default browser.</p>

<p>Of the four browsers I&#039;ve used on OS X, MSIE is probably the weakest, the slowest, most buggy -- but it&#039;s what ships with OS X. Nuts. (At the same time, MSIE on OS 9 is a damn nice browser.)</p>

<p>***Well</p>

<p>All this kvetching is because I like OS X. (And yes I&#039;ll send my feedback to Apple, no need to send me email.)</p>

<p>I want to use it more than I do.</p>

<p>For my own edification, I bought <a href="http://www1.fatbrain.com/asp/bookinfo/bookinfo.asp?theisbn=0596001606&vm=">Learning Cocoa</a> the other day -- and I&#039;m pleasantly surprised. Cocoa and Objective C seem (so far) much cooler than I expected. So when I see the mountain of things that are so damn right with OS X -- and Cocoa is just one of many things -- the few things that are not right just bug me all the more.</p>

<p>"tinyshoe.gif"</p>

<p>Of course, OS X <em>users</em> sometimes bug me. There&#039;s a perception that Carbon is somehow inferior, "less native," than Cocoa.</p>

<p>More bullshit.</p>

<p>Listen: Carbon and Cocoa are peers. Each have their strengths and weaknesses. Yes, Cocoa is cool -- but please, get over your fetish. To demand that developers rewrite their existing apps as Cocoa apps is stupid. What, do you <em>not want</em> Photoshop? I didn&#039;t think so.</p>

<p>I&#039;m pleased that Frontier users are such a smart bunch. I&#039;ve haven&#039;t heard this demanded of UserLand. Thanks!</p>

<p>I checked out <a href="http://www.opera.com/mac/">Opera for OS X</a> the other day. Fast. Nice. I recommend it. I actually prefer it to the OS 9 or Windows versions.</p>

<p>This is what happens when you&#039;re bad.</p>
