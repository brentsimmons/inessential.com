<p><em>Whatever.</em></p>

<p>There&#8217;s all this news about how Windows XP doesn&#8217;t crash. </p>

<p>Well, whoop-dee-doo.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 doesn&#8217;t crash on me either. It hangs in all kinds of unexpected and bizarre ways, but I&#8217;ve yet to see the Blue Screen of Death on it.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t plan to &#8220;upgrade&#8221; to XP. I don&#8217;t want to get slurped into the Passport/copy-protection/Microsoft-is-omniscient thing. Spare me. This is such a dark-side play it makes me sick.</p>

<p>I often get a kick out of the semi-literate sportscasters on national TV.</p>

<p>The other day one described Yankee pitcher Orlando Hernandez as &#8220;very imaginary on the mound.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Imaginary</em>&#8212;I like that. I could hit off someone who&#8217;s imaginary.</p>

<p>Repeat to self while standing in the batter&#8217;s box: there is no pitcher, there is no pitcher, there is no pitcher. He&#8217;s not real, not real, not real.</p>

<p><a href="http://burningbird.ManilaSites.Com/2001/10/22">Shelley Powers on Windows XP</a>: &#8220;The sad ending to this long tale is that the folks most loyal to Microsoft are the ones most likely to get kicked in the teeth by Microsoft&#8217;s new policies.&#8221;
