<p>My kitten is now big enough that he&#039;ll fight with my hand. I&#039;ve got these little tooth marks all over. I should use a sock or something.</p>

<p>But there&#039;s something exciting about how unerringly he goes for that skin between my thumb and index finger. A sock would cover that up.</p>
