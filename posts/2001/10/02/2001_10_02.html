<p>Sometimes when we release a new feature for Manila or fix a bug or whatever people thank me personally in email or on their websites.</p>

<p>Which is totally nice and I appreciate it. It feels good to be thanked.</p>

<p>But... Sometimes I&#039;m just the person who announced the feature. Or, I wrote the code, but other people designed the feature, or a group of people designed the feature. And so on.</p>

<p>Even if I personally did all the work on a particular feature, I&#039;m still building on years of work by other people.</p>

<p>What I mean is, it&#039;s <em>always</em> a team effort, so thanking UserLand is the thing to do, not thanking me personally.</p>

<p>I remember learning as a boy that in New York City they numbered the public schools, as in PS 130. I was envious because my school had only a name.</p>

<p>Where I lived you could count the schools on your fingers, so they didn&#039;t really need numbers, names worked fine. But I wanted a number, it sounded glamorous.</p>

<p>Why do I live in the city, not the suburbs or the country?</p>

<p>I think it&#039;s because of Sesame Street. I loved Sesame Street. It was cool how they could walk around and see people and have fun and there were all these wacky characters.</p>
