<p>Major congratulations to <a href="http://www.nobel.se/literature/laureates/2001/press.html">V.S. Naipaul</a> for winning the Nobel Literature prize. (Via <a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/2001/10/11">Sheila</a>.) An excellent choice.</p>

<p>I&#039;m pulling for both Philip Roth and Milan Kundera to win one of these years.</p>

<p>Every time they say Jalalabad on TV I hear "Jelly Bean Land."</p>

<p>Were I a poet, I&#039;d be thrilled that the names of these Middle East countries all rhyme.</p>

<p>Roses are red<br />

Violence in Pakistan<br />

American planes<br />

Drop their bombs in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>I started a <a href="http://mac.scripting.com/">Radio weblog</a>.</p>

<p>I wish animals could talk to me.</p>

<p>I wish I could breathe underwater.</p>

<p>I wish I could control time like a VCR. Stop, rewind, fast-forward, frame advance.</p>

<p>These are <em>feature requests</em>, if anyone&#039;s listening.</p>

<p>Is it okay to ask feature requests of God when so badly needed are bug fixes?</p>

<p>Is God just a user, the guy running this software, and if so is there someone more powerful, a programmer who wrote this software?</p>

<p>Has that programmer been on vacation for a few thousand years?</p>

<p>I think Uzbekistan<br />

And lovely Tjadjikistan<br />

Might make great friends<br />

With the U-S-of-A-istan.</p>
