<p>From now on, when I want to insult somebody, instead of calling them a jerk or a numbskull I&#039;m going to call them a nasal swab.</p>

<p>Hey you nasal swab, hey you nasal swab, get offa my yard.</p>

<p><img src="/images/atom.gif" height="30" width="29" border="0" alt="" /></p>

<p>&#8220;Jerk&#8221; is a mild insult, almost not worth bothering with.</p>

<p>But it&#039;s short for one of my favorite all-time insults: &#8220;jerk-off artist.&#8221; Now <em>that&#039;s</em> an insult. The guy jerks off so much, loves it so much, that he&#039;s become no less than an <em>artist</em>.</p>

<p>People don&#039;t call other people jerk-off artists often enough.</p>

<p>It&#039;s fun to come up with variations on the theme. For instance, one might affect a British accent and say, &#8220;While perhaps not the master of the onanistic arts, he&#039;s a devoted and highly skilled craftsman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Or one might imagine fighting a jerk-off artist. Picture a boxing ring, surronded by thousands of your adoring fans. Howard Cosell is introducing the bad guy.</p>

<p>Picture any bad guy you want. Okay, Osama Bin Laden. (That was easy.)</p>

<p>Anyway, here&#039;s Howard Cosell:</p>

<p>&#8220;And in this corner, all the way from Afghanistan, is the Picasso of pud-pulling, the Chagall of chicken-choking, the Pollock of penis-pulling, the Matisse of masturbation, the Jasper Johns of jerking off&#8212;terrorism&#039;s own Osama Bin Laden!&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowd boos and boos and boos. Ding ding! You knock him out in the first round.</p>
