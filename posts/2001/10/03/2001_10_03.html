<p>My favorite character was Big Bird.</p>

<p>I&#039;m old enough to have watched Sesame Street from the first season. I remember when they changed the actor who played Gordon. My mom had to explain it to me. A very difficult concept for a young child. I never liked the new Gordon as much as the old Gordon. I really missed him.</p>
