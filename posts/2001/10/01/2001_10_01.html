<p>If your weblog is a Manila site, then I&#039;m reading its print-friendly version. I&#039;m an addict. It&#039;s so fast to load, so clean and easy to read.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#039;s just me, but I see weblogs as the mammals and big publications as the dinosaurs. The dinosaurs are slow and overgrown. The mammals, smaller and more nimble, eat the dinosaur&#039;s eggs.</p>

<p>But some weblogs defy this metaphor with slow-loading, dinosaur-like templates.</p>

<p>My aesthetic -- and I speak only for myself -- is that while a good design is important, it&#039;s not nearly as important as the <em>words</em>. Weblogs really do live and die by the words. It&#039;s about writing.</p>

<p>So the words should pop to the front. The site should load quickly.</p>

<p>You can still have an attractive and interesting template, of course.</p>

<p>There are now thousands of webloggers. If you want to attract me, it needs to not be painful to go to your site. If I&#039;m on a T1 and I complain about loading times, what about the people on slower lines?</p>

<p>Think Bauhaus, think form-follows-function, think Shaker furniture.</p>

<p>Think small and fast, clever and warm-blooded.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s a telegram from John Q. Speedy, a fictional guy who makes a living optimizing website performance.</p>

<p>HERE&#039;s A TIP STOP IF YOU ARE USING JAVASCRIPT INCLUDES STOP</p>

<p>I&#039;m not the hard-ass he is, so I&#039;ll modify that a little bit.</p>

<p>Try to not to use more than one JavaScript include, and make sure it&#039;s calling a fast server.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, browsers have a hard time with JavaScript includes. Nothing drags down site performance like pages with multiple includes.</p>
