<p><a href="http://mac.scripting.com/">mac.scripting.com</a> is my Radio-built weblog covering the Macintosh scripting world.</p>

<p>I&#039;ll probably add a directory and other goodies, but I&#039;m feeling my way, doing one thing at a time. I&#039;ll see what kind of feedback I get.</p>

<p>The site has a deliberately plain template. If the site becomes popular, I want it to be because:</p>

<p>1. The links are valuable.</p>

<p>2. It&#039;s easy to read.</p>

<p>3. It loads super-quickly.</p>

<p>In other words, I don&#039;t want you to hesitate before you go there because you&#039;ve found it&#039;s slow, you don&#039;t like the graphics, or it&#039;s hard to separate news from ads.</p>

<p>There&#039;s an awful lot going on in the Mac scripting world -- not only can we write shell scripts on OS X, not only does Perl come with the OS, but Apple has added XML-RPC and SOAP support to AppleScript, which is a great move.</p>

<p>It&#039;s so windy this morning. Really excrementally windy.</p>

<p>When I was a boy I thought what was amazing about wind is how it&#039;s invisible but you can still feel it.</p>

<p>My kitten has the scamper madness one minute and then, boom, he&#039;s passed out on my lap.</p>

<p>We use him as a thermometer. If it&#039;s cold inside he curls up with a paw over his nose. If it&#039;s warm he stretches way out, a loooong kitty.</p>

<p>He&#039;s growing fast.</p>

<p>I wish I could be invisible at will. I&#039;d learn some foreign languages and join the CIA. I&#039;d be a spy. Nobody would be able to catch me.</p>

<p>They always said I wouldn&#039;t get zits once I wasn&#039;t a teenager anymore.</p>

<p>They were horribly, tragically mistaken.</p>
