<p>I got bored with what was on this page today.</p>

<p>How about something else?</p>

<p>I think it’s cool that there’s a <a href="http://www.davidgagne.net/hem/">Hemingway Blog</a>.</p>

<p>I love to think what Hemingway would have made of the word “blog.” Something unidentifiable you find on a battlefield somewhere in Spain? Maybe he would have used it instead of “nada” in “A Clean, Well-Lighted Place.”</p>

<p><blockquote>

It was only that and light was all it needed and a certain cleanness and order. Some lived in it and never felt it but he knew it all was blog y pues blog y blog y pues blog. Our blog who art in blog, blog be thy name thy kingdom blog thy will be blog in blog as it is in blog. Give us this blog our daily blog and blog us our blog as we blog our blogs and blog us not into blog but deliver us from blog; pues blog.

<p>People think I’m funny—funny in the head—because I always wear a <a href="http://www.onr.com/user/steveh/cods.htm">codpiece</a>.</p>

<p>But hey man, hey, I’m just <em>old-fashioned</em>.</p>
