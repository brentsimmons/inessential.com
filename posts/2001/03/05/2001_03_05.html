<p>It&#039;s a matter of record that the first words I spoke as a baby were not "ma" or "dad" but "Baskin-Robbins."</p>

<p>Like bad, bad Leroy Brown, I was born on the south side of Chicago, the baddest part of the whole damn town.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s how I get respect from people.</p>

<p>I wear a pinky ring on my right hand. People jokingly ask if I&#039;m in the mafia.</p>

<p>I answer seriously and truthfully, no, it&#039;s nothing like that, it&#039;s just a <em>family</em> thing.</p>

<p>Sometimes they reply with nervous laughter; sometimes they&#039;re just nervous.</p>

<p>"...oh, but I&#039;ve seen the real world, and that&#039;s not what this is."</p>

<p>Who said they couldn&#039;t hit? <a href="http://www.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/news/mlb_news_story.jsp?article_id=ap_20010304_CLroundup_news&team_id=mlb">Mariners beat Padres</a> yesterday 18-3. 19 hits.</p>

<p>Radio Nirvana: I&#039;m starting to develop patterns in how I personally use Radio.</p>

<p>I leave it running on my Windows 2000 machine. Then take my iBook -- which has a wireless connection via my AirPort -- and access my desktop website remotely. I&#039;m in the kitchen at the moment, but I could go upstairs, or to the living room, or outside, whatever.</p>

<p>And then of course I also run Radio on my iBook, but use it only for editing Manila sites and outlining.</p>

<p>This way I have just one machine doing the news thing. I can access it from anywhere. I don&#039;t have to try to synchronize across several machines.</p>

<p>Today someone brought up the notion of Radio passing or not passing the "Mom test."</p>

<p>Well, my Mom builds Web apps, does XML, browser-based content management, all that jazz. So I think she&#039;d be able to use Radio.
