<p>Sheila&#039;s always had it in for know-it-alls. I never thought about them much as a type until she told me about them. I have it in for know-it-alls too.</p>

<p>They&#039;re young, in their teens, 20s, or 30s. They answer every question. They volunteer answers even for questions they haven&#039;t been asked. They always act like they know more than everybody else. They never ask any questions -- unless it&#039;s a made-up question to prove how deep and original a thinker they are. Or unless the question itself is an attack of some kind, and they don&#039;t really care about the answer.</p>

<p>Difficult, shaded moral and ethical questions are always very clear to the know-it-all. They tend to be true believers in something. Lines are always very clear and hard, there&#039;s no room for the actual complex anarchy of life in their thinking.</p>

<p>They&#039;re intolerant for sure, lacking in empathy, and tend towards cynicism, reserving praise only for the objects of their faith.</p>

<p>Know-it-alls are almost always men, but not always; even if they&#039;re women they tend to be condescending to women, who they apparently think are good creatures who just don&#039;t know things.
