<p>"radioCoffeeMug"</p>

<p>To friends and family who keep asking -- "Have you released yet?" -- the answer is now -- Yes!</p>

<p>Click on the coffee mug. Read, download, have fun.</p>

<p>You have no idea how tired I am. I&#039;ve been running on fumes for the last few days. I don&#039;t know what it looks like from the outside, but from the inside we&#039;re just a few guys who work very damn hard.</p>

<p>But now is a critical time too -- we call it follow-through. You don&#039;t just release and go to sleep, you listen to the users, work with them, answer questions, refine docs, fix bugs.</p>

<p>It&#039;s still work, but it&#039;s less stressful than shipping.</p>

<p>I felt like doing a tour of sites run by Manila and/or Radio, to see what&#039;s cool here in early March 2001.</p>

<p>This is a totally subjective and pretty random thing -- I know I&#039;m missing some pretty cool sites. You can always post on the dg or send me email. It&#039;s likely I&#039;ll do more tours in the future. They&#039;re fun.</p>

<p>You probably already know about some or most of these sites, but hopefully some of them will be new to you, or worth a second look.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/">Sheila&#039;s Web Site</a></strong><br />
She&#039;s not just my wife, she&#039;s a better weblogger than I am. You won&#039;t usually find lots of acerbic opinion or links to the latest disasters -- instead, her mission is to find the fun and funny stuff. Mariners links are a bonus.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://scobleizer.manilasites.com/">Scobleizer</a></strong><br />
If you haven&#039;t been scobleized yet, you will be. Robert Scoble is a fairly new weblogger who&#039;s coming on strong.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://glennf.weblogs.com/">GlennLogs</a></strong><br />
Glenn Fleishman, a fellow Seattle-ite, has been there and done that -- and he&#039;s a good writer. Real good. Adjectives-escape-me good.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://searchrequests.weblogs.com/">Disturbing Search Requests</a></strong><br />
Theory: the best sites are either personal sites that cover lots of topics, or collaborative sites that cover a single topic. This is the latter type -- and what a great topic. Worth at least one visit a day. It&#039;s my favorite freakshow.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://adamcurry.editthispage.com/">Adam Curry&#039;s Weblog</a></strong><br />
Possessed of one of the all-time great taglines -- "There are no secrets -- Only information you don&#039;t yet have" -- this site is one of the earliest joint Manila/Radio productions. Good links from a guy who loves the Web as a medium.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://blackholebrain.editthispage.com/">blackholebrain</a></strong><br />
This site is the reason why drugs are illegal. (Oh, I&#039;m so totally just kidding. Mike&#039;s a good guy, though his brain is so massive and dense that nothing, not even light, can escape it.)</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://php.weblogs.com/">PHPEveryWhere</a></strong><br />
Dig PHP? You&#039;re not alone. This wildly popular Web scripting system is nicely covered  by this weblog.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://hal.editthispage.com/">blivet</a></strong><br />
The award for nicest guy on the net may go to the inaptly named Hal B. Rager. Hey, I wish my name was <em>Rager</em>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.weblogger.com/">Weblogger.Com</a></strong><br />
This is a Manila site hosting service -- beautifully designed by Bryan Bell, who&#039;s also designed a number of UserLand sites and the most popular Manila themes. (The <em>least</em> popular Manila themes were designed by me.) Also check out <a href="http://design.weblogger.com/">Design.Weblogger.Com</a> and <a href="http://linux.weblogger.com/">Linux.Weblogger.Com</a>.</p>

Though infrequently updated, there&#039;s lots of good stuff here in the tip archive. Written by a guy who&#039;s both clear-headed and a good teacher, it&#039;s free of the rah-rah junk you see elsewhere -- instead, it&#039;s actually <em>useful</em> and easy to read.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://macosx.weblogs.com/">MacOSXweblog</a></strong><br />
Another site with one topic but many authors, this is my first stop for OS X news. It&#039;s one of the first sites I subcribed to in Radio.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://dew.weblogs.com/">web dew</a></strong><br />
Highly personal good writing every day from Gregg Hartling.</p>

<p>The Village Voice: <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0110/gallagher.shtml">Teacup Rescue Dogs Vancouver</a> is a pretty nice article about <a href="http://searchrequests.weblogs.com/">Disturbing Search Requests</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How to get a big head</strong></p>

<p>Back in the &#039;70s I was a boy and I watched Sesame Street and Mister Rogers and Electric Company on public television.</p>

<p>In those days, between shows they would show their logo on the screen. On a black background were the giant letters PBS. My initials are PBS, so Mom would say: that&#039;s you. I&#039;d say: that&#039;s me, I&#039;m PBS.</p>

<p>It didn&#039;t seem strange at all.</p>

<p>I still use PBS as my initials, even though I&#039;ve always gone by my middle name. (If you look through the source code in Radio or Frontier, you&#039;ll see my initials a few times.)</p>

<p>I could just use my middle and last name -- but then my initials are BS, which I like a whole lot less.
