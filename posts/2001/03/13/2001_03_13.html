<p>The Mariners game is televised tonight. Shew. Baseball again. At long last I can breathe.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amcorner.com/irscorner/">IRS Records</a> was the greatest record label ever. I miss it.</p>

<p>it&#039;s a neat trick how<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you break up your sentence<br />
like a poem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it seems more profound<br />
than it is really.<br />
all lower-case<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is also<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indicated.</p>

<p>When I was a boy I thought there was a connection between <a href="http://mineral.galleries.com/minerals/silicate/micas.htm">mica</a> -- which we found along the stream beds in the forest behind my house -- and fingernails. Both were sort of clear; you could split them and peel off a layer.</p>

<p>The science of childhood: like things are connected.</p>

<p>An article at Kuro5hin about having to wear suits: <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/?op=displaystory;sid=2001/3/13/125217/290">Monkey See - Monkey Do</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike many people, I don&#039;t think suits are a priori bad. Look at Humphrey Bogart or your favorite ska band -- cool guys, looking <em>fierce</em> in their suits.</p>

<p>But it makes me think about what I wear to work.</p>

<p>When I&#039;m working on Radio -- which is all cutting edge and P2P-ish and all -- I dress totally in black. I&#039;m going for a relaxed cool, a la Isaac Mizrahi. I say "fabulous" and "chic" alot.</p>

<p>When I&#039;m working in Frontier and Manila -- old friends -- I dress comfortably, in tight leather pants and a sharkskin shirt.</p>

<p>When I&#039;m working on the kernel, my outfit is somewhat metaphoric -- I&#039;m going to the heart of things, stripping away all the layers. So naturally I&#039;m buck naked. Plus I like the feel of the leather chair under my butt.</p>

<p>Of course, right before Sheila comes home I switch to jeans and a T-shirt so she won&#039;t think her husband is a freak.
