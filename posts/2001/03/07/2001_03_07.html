<p>I was watching a news show on network TV last night and someone they were interviewing used the word "shit" and they didn&#039;t bleep it out.</p>

<p>I was so surprised.</p>

<p>But then I realized how fucked up it is that it&#039;s surprising and rare when on TV they&#039;re brave enough to use a word that every 8-year-old uses.</p>

<p>I&#039;m not saying that TV should be coarsened more than it is. It&#039;s like it&#039;s upside down. There&#039;s tons of stuff on TV far, far more offensive than the word "shit." It would be refreshing to allow people on TV to be able to talk like people.</p>

<p>You can see the most hideous acts of real violence, enough to traumatize anybody who isn&#039;t already a monster, but no uncensored scenes of girls flashing their boobs on Bourbon Street. Oh please. It&#039;s just so weird.</p>

<p>I love TV. But I wish it were better.</p>

<p>It would be great if on <a href="http://www.trektoday.com/">Star Trek</a> Worf could say: "They are cowards with no fucking honor."</p>

<p>Or maybe <a href="http://www.suzeorman.com/">Suze Orman</a> on some money show: "Don&#039;t fucking invest in the goddamn bond market, your money will turn to fucking shit."
