<p>I&#039;ve always loved this paragraph that opens "The Snows of Kilimanjaro" by <a href="http://dmoz.org/Arts/Literature/Authors/H/Hemingway,_Ernest/">Ernest Hemingway</a>.</p>

<p>"Kilimanjaro is a snow covered mountain 19,710 feet high, and is said to be the highest mountain in Africa. Its western summit is called the Masai &#039;Ngàje Ngài,&#039; the House of God. Close to the western summit there is the dried and frozen carcass of a leopard. No one has explained what the leopard was seeking at that altitude."</p>

<p>It&#039;s good to have baseball on the radio again.</p>
