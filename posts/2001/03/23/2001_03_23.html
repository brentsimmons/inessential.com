<p>Radio tip: how to be 10 minutes ahead of everyone else. Go to the Prefs page, and set the time to do a scan to 50 minutes after the hour. If you then go to your Radio site right after the scan, you&#039;ll update 10 minutes before everybody else. Why is that cool? It just makes you seem fast. And it means when other people pick up your channels on the hour, you&#039;ll have the news first. "Oh, I could blog this," they&#039;ll say, "but it looks like, as usual, John Doe already beat me to it. How does he do it?"</p>

<p>Better still -- it means your scan isn&#039;t competing with everybody else&#039;s scan which is running every hour on the hour. So your scans run faster.</p>

<p>Here&#039;s a picture I dig from Sheila&#039;s site. Here&#039;s the <a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/stories/storyReader$257">story</a> (from a year ago this month) it&#039;s attached to.</p>

<p>I don&#039;t like to think of it as going gray, I like to think of it as going blonde.
