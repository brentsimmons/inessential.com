<p>Me, I&#039;m fixing bugs today. Watch <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/news/2001/03/20">Frontier News</a> for progress. Or, better yet, subscribe to it. (It&#039;s on the Hot List page in Radio.)</p>

<p>This <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$7173">Frontier dg thread</a> is cool. Partly because it&#039;s users helping users -- but also for the solution. A person wants Tomcat to generate JSP pages behind Frontier. Tomcat&#039;s port must remain hidden -- the person doesn&#039;t want other people to connect directly to Tomcat. So the solution <a href="http://www.kensdigest.com/">Ken Dow</a> came up with was to have Frontier call Tomcat via HTTP and return the result.</p>

<p>One of the bummer parts about software development is the boring housekeeping and futzing you have to do sometimes. Yesterday I got my Mac OS X release candidate CD. Cool -- I immediately installed it on three machines, including my development environment. But now, once again, I can&#039;t debug. I went down this road when I installed Mac OS X public beta -- so I know there&#039;s a solution, I just can&#039;t remember what it is. Oh well, I&#039;ll find it.</p>

<p>But then I noticed there&#039;s an update to CodeWarrior, and a new Carbon SDK and new Universal Interfaces. Ugh. So yet more downloading and installing and futzing. Nuts.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, according to the paperwork that came with the OS X CD, I can&#039;t talk about it. But if you look around you&#039;ll find lots of sites talking about the release candidate, so you&#039;re not missing anything by me not talking about it. And anyway the official release is just days away.</p>
