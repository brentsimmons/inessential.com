<p>Sheila&#039;s got the scoop on <a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/2001/03/18">Mir&#039;s fall to earth</a>.</p>

<p>It reminds me of my favorite movie of all time, <a href="http://www.wim-wenders.com/movies/movies_spec/untiltheendoftheworld/untiltheendoftheworld.htm">Until the End of the World</a>. "1999 was the year the Indian nuclear satellite went out of control. No one knew where it might land. It soared above the ozone layer like a lethal bird of prey. The whole world was alarmed. Claire couldn&#039;t care less."</p>

<p>It also reminds me of <a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/skylab.html">Skylab</a>. I remember watching on TV when I was a boy, wondering where it was going to land.</p>

<p>And then there&#039;s that old <a href="http://www.billybragg.co.uk/life4.html">Billy Bragg song</a>: "I saw two shooting stars last night/I wished on them but they were only satellites/Is it wrong to wish on space hardware/I wish, I wish, I wish you&#039;d care."</p>

<p>If you live in the Northwest, stop what you&#039;re doing and turn on Fox Sports. The Mariners are leading 2-0 in the first inning (at this writing). They&#039;re hitting singles and doubles. Edgar Martinez hit an opposite-field double off the base of the wall. It&#039;s a beautiful sunny day in Arizona. Freddy Garcia -- the Chief -- is pitching. Freddy is making the Cubs look like little girls. Leetle gu-wuls.</p>

<p>Update 2:40 p.m.: Mariners go on to lose 6-2. Well that&#039;s baseball for ya.</p>

<p>Oliver Wrede: <a href="http://owrede.khm.de/dev/goldenrules">Golden Rules for Newbies to Frontier and Radio UserLand</a>. I like this alot -- it&#039;s very cool to see people write perceptively and intelligently about any technology, and it&#039;s doubly cool when it&#039;s your own products being written about.
