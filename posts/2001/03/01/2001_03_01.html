<p>I picked Kathyrn as the <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/themole/mole_home.html">Mole</a> in the second or third episode. I was thinking about the aftermath of Survivor, and how they were all on talk shows, and they were all pretty yucky.</p>

<p>I knew that the Mole would produce at least two people for the talk-show circuit -- the winner, who they couldn&#039;t pick, and the Mole, who they could pick.</p>

<p>So, knowing that they had control over at least one of the people, I pictured a guest on Jay Leno wearing a short black skirt. Who did I think they would think would look best in a short black skirt? Kathryn.</p>

<p>I have no idea if my reasoning was on target or not, but I picked right.</p>

<p>What scared me was the <a href="http://home.nbci.com/LMOID/bb/fd/0,946,-0-2152,00.html?tag=e-nt.protc.s-2757.e-nt.0">Will & Grace</a> <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/some_of_my_best_friends/">effect</a>; I was afraid it might be <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/themole/profiles/jim.html">Jim</a>. But I counted on timing, that the Will & Grace effect hadn&#039;t really started kicking in when the producers chose the Mole.</p>

<p>Sheila and I had the misfortune of being in <em>both</em> of the two most recent major earthquakes in the U.S. In 1999 we went to Los Angeles for a weekend. The only time we&#039;ve ever been there. About an hour after checking into our hotel, a 7.1 hit north of the city. We were on the eight floor (something like that). The building was swaying like crazy.</p>

<p>That&#039;s just bad luck. I don&#039;t knock on wood nearly enough, or throw salt over my shoulder.</p>

<p>Yesterday&#039;s earthquake was just a drill. We practiced getting the word out via the Internet. Of course, had it been more serious, it might have been impossible to get the word out.
