<p>If someone asks you who created the world, you should be honest and tell them the truth. It was <a href="http://www.chuckberry.com/">Chuck Berry</a>.</p>

<p>Oh nuts, we&#039;ve been <a href="http://radio.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$5694">found out</a>. What should I do now? I think: panic.</p>

<p>Sometimes you get lucky and you get on a streak where your dreams are really good dreams.</p>

<p>Remember that awful story about the monarch butterflies in Mexico?</p>

<p>Last night in a dream I was looking outside at the back yard. More than in real life it was a tangle of trees and flowers and vines. I saw a monarch butterfly. Then I saw another one. And a third. I started counting.</p>

<p>Suddenly my eyes focused and I could see there were thousands of monarch butterflys in my back yard.</p>

<p>I turned and called to Sheila: They&#039;re here! I was so happy that they&#039;d escaped, they&#039;re alright now, and they&#039;ve come to stay with me and Sheila.</p>

<p>It was a great dream, heart-breaking only now when I&#039;m awake.
