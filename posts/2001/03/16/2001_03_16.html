<p>I was at Microsoft yesterday, at the Hailstorm Design Preview. I&#039;m under nda, so I can&#039;t talk about it. When I can, I probably will. It&#039;s a story worth following, even if you&#039;re not a Microsoft-watcher, because it&#039;s a Web story, there are larger themes involved.</p>

<p>In the meantime, <a href="http://scobleizer.ManilaSites.Com/2001/03/16">Robert Scoble</a> has some reporting about it.</p>

<p>I&#039;m going to write about religion, but I&#039;m not going to say anything controversial, so it&#039;s safe to read on. I&#039;m also not going to reveal anything about my personal religious beliefs.</p>

<p>The word agnostic interests me -- it seems to me that the meaning of the word is drifting.</p>

<p>The common meaning is that an agnostic is one who neither affirms nor denies the existence of a deity.</p>

<p>But the word means something different than that -- an agnostic is the opposite of a Gnostic. A Gnostic believes that God is knowable.</p>

<p>An agnostic believes that God is <em>not</em> knowable.</p>

<p>Agnosticism is a statement about <em>knowledge</em> of God, not about God itself.</p>

<p>In other words, an agnostic is not someone who says "I don&#039;t know if God exists or not." An agnostic says "It&#039;s <em>impossible</em> to know if God exists or not."</p>

<p>That&#039;s a much bolder statement than a statement of being unsure. An agnostic is very sure.</p>

<p>There are several subtly different meanings for the word <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=agnostic">agnostic</a> even at Dictionary.Com. But note the Word History section: "The term <em>agnostic</em> was fittingly coined by the 19th-century British scientist Thomas H. Huxley, who believed that only material phenomena were objects of exact knowledge. He made up the word from the prefix a-, meaning &#039;without, not,&#039; as in <em>amoral</em>, and the noun <em>Gnostic</em>."</p>

<p>So if you&#039;ve been calling yourself an agnostic, you might want to double-check. Do you deny the very possibility of knowledge of God? If not, then perhaps you&#039;re a skeptic, Deist, or simply undecided.</p>

<p>(I first became interested in this word when reading the later works of the science fiction writer <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?author_last=Dick&author_first=Philip+K%2E&match=exact&options=and">Philip K. Dick</a> -- a modern-day Gnostic. Good stuff, definitely worth reading.)
