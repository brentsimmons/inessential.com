<p>Mariners are 30-9. Ichiro has a 21 game hitting streak. We won 7-2 last night.</p>

<p>Yup, we need a new hitter as much we need Bobby Ayala back in the bullpen. (In other words, we need a hitter as much as we need newer, more virulent contagious diseases.)</p>

<p><em>Update 3:45 PM</em>: Ichiro now has a 22 game hitting streak, with a single in the first inning against David Wells of the White Sox. (And then Ichiro stole second base. And then Ichiro stole third base.)</p>

<p><em>Update 6:30 PM</em>. Mariners win 5-1, are now 31-9. They have the second-best record after 40 games in major league history, according to announcer Dave Niehaus. (Behind, if I remember right, the Tigers&#039; 35-5 record in the early &#039;80s. Tied with the Yankees 1998 31-9 record.)</p>

"What I&#039;ve seen in the past six days is a young man tormented by the Rangers&#039; failure to win, deeply hurt by the fans&#039; constant vocal disdain and perhaps as unhappy as he has ever been in his life."
