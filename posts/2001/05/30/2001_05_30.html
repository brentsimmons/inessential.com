<p>When I was young I thought, naively, that superior intelligence breeds superior morality.</p>

<p>The software industry, a group of smart people if there ever was one, proves how wrong I was. Looking around at Microsoft and the Open Source community and blah blah blah, I can&#039;t believe I ever thought what I thought.</p>

<p>The software industry is sick in bed with the flu, a thermometer sticking out of its mouth, its pillow cold with sweat, an untouched glass of flat ginger ale on the nightstand.</p>
