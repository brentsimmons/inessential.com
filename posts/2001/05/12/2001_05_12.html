<p>Now it can be told...</p>

<p>This site was the first Manila site to be served by Frontier for OS X. Sometime in April I made the switch from an NT server to a <a href="http://frontier-osx.userland.com/aboutThisServer">G4 Cube</a>.</p>

<p>The second site was the <a href="http://frontier-osx.userland.com/">Frontier-OSX site</a>, of course.</p>

<p>Andr≈Ω Radke announces <a href="http://spicynoodles.com/2001/05/11">Regex 2.0.2b3</a>, which includes some bug fixes and is carbonized, so it works with OS X Frontier.</p>

<p>Part of the fun of Frontier for OS X is exploring the new environment. One of the things I did was write a mini-app that allows you to <a href="http://frontier-osx.userland.com/callingFrontier">call Frontier from the command line</a>. This app was done using ProjectBuilder -- which is the first time I&#039;ve used ProjectBuilder. It was... different. At first I didn&#039;t like it at all, but it grew on me quickly, and I soon found it charming.</p>

<p>I want to re-iterate the thanks to Tim Paustian -- he&#039;s done a wonderful job on carbonizing Frontier. My personal thanks go to Tim for his enthusiasm and hard work. To every Frontier user who runs OS X -- if you get a chance to send Tim your thanks, please do so.</p>
