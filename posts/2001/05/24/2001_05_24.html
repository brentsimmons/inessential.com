<p>I&#039;m working on Frontier 7. Gotta ship this puppy. The to-do list is getting short.</p>

<p>I started reading Daniel Boorstin&#039;s <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0679743758">The Creators</a> last night. I&#039;m just a dozen or so pages into it -- but so far it&#039;s utterly entrancing. I read <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0394726251">The Discoverers</a> a few months ago and recommend it unreservedly.</p>

<p>I&#039;m going to have the weirdest French accent. I have these French lessons on cassette tape, but I hadn&#039;t figured out when I would have to time to do them.</p>

<p>Then it occurred to me -- why not do them while I work out?</p>

<p>So there I am, doing my workout, trying to speak French -- je (breath) voudrais (breath) un verre (breath) de vin (deep breath) rouge.</p>

<p>Alors.</p>
