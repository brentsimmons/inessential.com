<p>The other day I was explaining to Dave how punk rock and the Two-Way-Web have elements in common. This is from an email I sent:</p>

<p><blockquote>

The central tenets of the punk movement:</p>

<p>1. Amateurs -- people who make music because they love it -- rock.</p>

<p>2. Do-it-yourself! (Abbreviated as DiY).</p>

<p>3. Everybody who wants to be heard (be in a band), should be able to.</p>

<p>4. There should be no barriers, and no difference, between a band and its fans. The two-way music scene. Fans are in bands too, and people in bands are fans of other bands.

</blockquote></p>

<p>To say that I&#039;m a punker may be a bit of a stretch -- I&#039;m a married homeowner, middle-class, with a 401K plan -- but still, the punk ethic was the philosophy I was raised with. That&#039;s true for lots of people in my age group.</p>

<p>Remember the music scene in the &#039;70s. You had bands like Pink Floyd and various "progressive" rock bands using orchestras and synthesizers and really expensive weird studio junk. The average kid who wanted to form a band had no hope of being able to do anything like that.</p>

<p>Rock was the people&#039;s music in one sense only -- people listened to it. But they couldn&#039;t <em>create</em> it anymore.</p>

<p>Then along comes Iggy Pop, the Ramones, the Sex Pistols, the Clash, Lou Reed -- and a new ethos.</p>

<p>We&#039;re back to three or four instruments. Drums, bass, guitar, a singer.</p>

<p>You didn&#039;t even really have to play your instrument very well, as the Sex Pistols proved -- what counted was spirit and expressiveness.</p>

<p>That punk may have seemed threatening to baby boomers isn&#039;t surprising. It <em>was</em> an attempt at a cultural revolution, an attempt at overthrowing corporate rock and all the over-blown Pink Floyd stuff that baby boomers liked. It was an attempt to kill the culture of rock stars.</p>

<p>It was a fiercely democratic movement.</p>

<p>For an excellent introduction to punk rock, get the Clash&#039;s album London Calling. You&#039;ll find that it&#039;s surprisingly accessible -- with catchy melodies, even. Good, straightforward rock-and-roll. And as powerful now as the day it was released.</p>

<p>PS I wrote about the similarities between punk and the Two-Way-Web <a href="http://inessential.com/2000/07/06.html">once before</a>.</p>
