<p>Sheila and I do a lot of gardening. Our yard isn&#039;t big. We know every square inch of it.</p>

<p>So when little bits of aluminum foil and other shiny things show up here and there, we know it&#039;s birds.</p>

<p>It&#039;s not annoying, actually. If I act annoyed it&#039;s mock-annoyed, just because it&#039;s fun. "Oh, those crazy birds, what&#039;ll they do next?"</p>

<p>It&#039;s enoyably weird that the universe evolved this way, that there would be such a thing as aluminum foil and that crows would happen to distribute it around my yard from time to time.</p>

<p>It&#039;s surprising. Were I inventing a world as fiction, I would not have come up with this detail.</p>

<p>And why do crows have that raspy caw instead of the sweeter chirps of other birds? Why are crows always black -- why is there no brown crow, no yellow-breasted crow, no blue-crested crow?</p>

<p>Many readers naturally associate crows with Edgar Allen Poe&#039;s poem. Me I think of Kafka -- whose last name translates as jackdaw, a black bird related to the crow. Had he been American, his name would have been Frank Blackbird, which is kind of a cool name.</p>

<p>Kafka -- he had the imagination for detail, he would have come up with crows dropping bits of aluminum foil in one&#039;s backyard.</p>

<p>One thing I&#039;ve always liked about Kafka&#039;s stories is that as metaphor they&#039;re usually opaque. When a guy turns into a beetle it&#039;s natural to think it&#039;s like a fable of some kind, somehow a metaphor for something. But it&#039;s not. It&#039;s really a story about a guy who turned into a beetle.</p>

<p>I&#039;m ambivalent about metaphors. Like so many other people, my brain naturally draws connections. This is like that, and this other thing is like that other thing.</p>

<p>Metaphors help one to see clearly -- except when they don&#039;t. Too much metaphor and the world becomes an undifferentiated, unaesthetic soup, where everything is like everything else but nothing is itself.</p>

<p>So the crows&#039; weird habit of littering shiny objects in my yard -- it doesn&#039;t remind me of anything else. It&#039;s not like anything else. As metaphor it&#039;s opaque. (At least to me.) It&#039;s just what it is, surprising and beautiful on its own.</p>

<p>So I like it.</p>
