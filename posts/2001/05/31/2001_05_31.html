<p>Now it can be told...</p>

<p>Yesterday I read an <a href="http://www.macslash.com/article.pl?sid=01/05/30/1812247">interview with Rich Siegel</a> (of BBEdit fame). He said that the "tools we had to use didn&#039;t work very well on X."</p>

<p>I&#039;m going to amplify this a bit. Most Mac users probably don&#039;t realize what it&#039;s like from the developer&#039;s point of view.</p>

<p>We use Metrowerks CodeWarrior, like pretty much everyone else. (Though ProjectBuilder is gaining ground.)</p>

<p>It was nearly impossible to get debugging working on OS X. In the end, someone figured out you could set up remote debugging on the same machine. It&#039;s totally slow, you have no idea. Just totally painful. And often unreliable. For instance, it&#039;s impossible to debug running MacBird cards in Frontier.</p>

<p>(But it did work -- without debugging, there would be no OS X version at all.)</p>

<p>And then there were other bugs -- typing in CodeWarrior on OS X is way slow.  More pain.</p>

<p>There was no way to connect to our version control system (which is Windows-based). So I had to take careful notes and boot back into OS 9 and get the VCS caught up from time to time.</p>

<p>I&#039;m not here to throw rocks at Metrowerks. Based on their track record, they will have a very good version of CodeWarrior for OS X before long. They make great tools.</p>

<p>But the reality is that it takes time.</p>

<p>As much as I complain about Metrowerks, they probably have similar complaints about Apple. Everybody builds on someone else&#039;s work.</p>

<p>Now, we worked through the problems, and got to beta, and we&#039;ll soon be shipping Frontier for OS X. BBEdit for OS X is already shipping (kudos to the Bare Bones folks).</p>

<p>To everybody waiting for apps X, Y, and Z for OS X, you should know what the developers are going through. It takes time, even when the tools are totally there. But they&#039;re not there. So it takes double the time, at least.</p>

<p>Of course, the developers often get blamed. And the developers could blame Metrowerks, who could blame Apple -- but that&#039;s all stupid stuff. The truth is that this is a new OS, and everyone&#039;s working hard, but patience is required all around.</p>
