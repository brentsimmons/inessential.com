<p>Sports fans -- or at least the ones that call talk radio -- can be so totally stupid. I have sports radio on in the background. A few callers have called to say that the Mariners need to make a trade for a hitter. Huh? At 29-9, the M&#039;s have the best record in baseball. They have pitching, defense, hitting, speed, chemistry. I can&#039;t imagine a trade where they wouldn&#039;t give up more than they&#039;re getting.</p>

<p>Specifically, the rumor is that the Rangers are shopping Ivan Rodriguez. <em>Pudge.</em> So what -- what, you want to give up Freddy Garcia for Pudge? No way. Not in a million years, you freaks. Go to blazes.</p>

<p><a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/news/2001/05/14/glance_mlb/">Can Ichiro</a> approach DiMaggio&#039;s 56-game hitting streak record? Some people think it&#039;s possible. Wow.</p>

<p>If that happened, <em>I would freak out</em>.</p>
