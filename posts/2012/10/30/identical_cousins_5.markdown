Michael and I just posted <a href="http://identicalcousins.net/2012/10/30/identical_cousins_5_autumn_changes">episode 5 of Identical Cousins</a>. Five episodes! Weâ€™re doing this.

As we were talking prior to recording, Apple posted the press release about the departure of Scott Forstall, so we talk about that.

I also complain about iCloud Core Data syncing, and then give my love to trains.
