<a href="https://join.app.net/">The App.net pitch</a> says, “We believe that advertising-supported social services are so consistently and inextricably at odds with the interests of users and developers that something must be done.”

I backed the project, and I agree.

But if you asked me why I want a Twitter alternative to succeed, I don’t think I’d express it so well. I’d say things like “because I fucking hate ads” and “because I fucking hate celebrities” and “because I fucking hate trending topics.”

So App.net won’t have ads — but I also hope it’s a long time before the Biebers, Kuchers, and their idiocratic, smeghead fans discover the service.

I wonder, just a little bit, if my attitude makes me out to be a jerk. I think it probably does — and I think, in this case, I don’t care.

As long as it costs money, it’s probably safe, I realize. (I hope.)
