Dave’s added an <a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=apple">Apple tab</a> to his news river. Good selection of feeds.

<i>Update 7:40 pm</i>: Underneath is a <a href="http://static.scripting.com/houston/rivers/apple/River3.js">JSON feed</a>. Which makes it super-easy to re-purpose and display however you want.

If you started today, you could write an iOS or Mac app that displayed a river of news in a day. It wouldn't be pretty, and it might not perform well, with just a day’s work, but you could easily write the code to:

– Download a file.

– Parse it with JSON.

– Store it using Core Data.

– Display it in a table view.
