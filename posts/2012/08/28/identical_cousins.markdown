Michael Simmons and I <a href="http://identicalcousins.net">started a podcast</a>.

As a guy who wrote an RSS reader for years, I’m surprised it took me till now to do my own podcast.

They’re <em>much</em> harder to do than I expected. I still suck — I need practice. (Michael’s better at this than I am. Luckily for me, he’s <em>patient</em>.)

Doing this certainly increases my respect for the people who do this well, who make it sound so easy.

(My favorite podcast is, by the way, <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/">Roderick on the Line</a>, by Merlin Mann and fellow Seattle-ite John Roderick.)

The name Identical Cousins is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Duke_Show">Patty Duke Show</a> reference. We’ve already made the required hot dog jokes. :)
