We added board exporting to Glassboard â€” see the <a href="http://macdrifter.com/2012/08/more-on-glassboard-data-portability.html">write-up on MacDrifter</a>.

We chose HTML as the first format to support. (We might offer choices in the future. And might not, since HTML is universal.)

Nick Harris did a good job on this. As I recall he had to fight some libraries to make them work with Unicode. (Which is never a fun time, and it makes me so glad to live every day in the NSString world.)
