I took a quick look at the <a href="http://tent.io/docs">Tent docs</a>.

My first thought: if we didn’t have email, and we asked someone to design email, they’d come up with this.

They’d use REST, JSON, HTTPS, and OAuth. People would be addressed by a URL.

But set the modern bits aside, and it’s still much like email or Usenet. Servers talking to servers. People using client apps. No centralized authority.

A whole lot of the internet works this way.
