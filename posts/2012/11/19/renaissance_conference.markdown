I’ll be speaking at <a href="http://renaissance.io/">Renaissance</a> in later January next year. The idea behind the conference:

>The first Renaissance happened at the center of commerce and travel in Europe.

>This Renaissance is happening at the crossroads of design, business, and technology.

My topic is <a href="http://renaissance.io/sessions/the_enterprise_is_everywhere">The Enterprise is Everywhere</a>. With Glassboard we set out to write software that helps people work together, without ever saying that it’s enterprise software, without doing all the traditional things enterprise software companies do. If it’s enterprise software, it’s part of a new breed.
