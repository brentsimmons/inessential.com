Every time I copy an email address from Address Book, I wonder why it’s so difficult. (Maybe it’s easier in Mountain Lion. I’m using Lion.)

I expect an email address to be treated as a unit, similar to how Mail treats an address, instead of as a collection of characters. (Except when editing.)

Instead it’s necessary to select the characters — triple-click, or click-hold-swipe, or click and cmd-A — and then copy.
