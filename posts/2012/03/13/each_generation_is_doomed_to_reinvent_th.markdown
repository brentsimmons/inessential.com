Here’s the thing about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CueCat">CueCat</a>: it wasn’t that the hardware sucked, it’s that people aren’t going to scan things to go to a web page.

And yet now we have QR codes, which we’re laughing at, and which will disappear like an American Idol contestant.
