With <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/quickcursor">QuickCursor</a> I can edit whatever text I see in BBEdit. (It supports a bunch of other editors too, of course.)

I wish Iâ€™d known about this app sooner. Heard about it from <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2012/03/10/12802">Alex King</a>.
