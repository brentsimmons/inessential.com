Okay, it’s probably not strictly accurate to say we don’t have a business plan or model, as reported yesterday. We do. We have a bunch of details to fill in, though.

The gist: free app, no advertising, and things-to-charge-for. We haven’t worked out the details on the things-to-charge-for part, but we have a bunch of ideas. (And are open to more, of course.)

In other words, it’s a fairly traditional idea. *Not* about “monetizing eyeballs” — it’s about creating quality software that people like and selling additional somethings that people will pay for.

There’s a <a href="http://glassboard.com/blog/2012/03/20/show-me-the-money-lol/">follow-up on the blog</a>.
