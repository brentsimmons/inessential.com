Say you’re editing a xib in Xcode, and you want to move a thing down.

So you show the Size inspector and find the Y axis stepper.

And you have a choice: click the down arrow or the up arrow?

You want the thing to go down, so you click the down arrow. And the thing goes up.

I’ll never, ever get used to this, no matter how much it makes sense.
