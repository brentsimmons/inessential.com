>This proposal introduces a new kind of selector that carries a namespace in addition to, but distinct from, its keywords. It redefines classes, categories and protocols to be members of namespaces, and provides rules for what namespaces their methods belong to.

I’m not sure that we need namespaces. It would solve some problems by adding complexity — too much, I think.

But I’m not sure I’m right.
