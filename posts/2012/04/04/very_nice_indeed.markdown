I didn’t know Pacific Northwest neighbor <a href="http://verynicewebsite.net/">John Moltz</a> had a new-ish website. I subscribed to the <a href="http://verynicewebsite.net/feed/">feed</a>.

(John lives in the Pacific Northwest, yes, but just enough offshore to be in international waters, where he’s legal.)
