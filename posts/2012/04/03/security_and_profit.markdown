I agree that the biggest problem with security is a lack of attention. But I also think that a lot of security issues, at least in the past, were a result of developers seeking to profit by making their software easier-to-use at the expense of security.

There’s no need to point the finger just at Outlook and IE and Windows. An example that persists, and that bothers me, is Safari’s “Open ‘safe’ files after downloading” preference, which defaults to on.
