Since <a href="http://flexibits.com/blog/2012/01/fantastical-1-2-going-global/">Fantastical</a> is all about natural language processing, localization is an especially interesting issue.

With most apps, localization means translating menus and labels into other languages and displaying the right translations based on a user’s language settings. But Fantastical has to go farther: it has to understand what you type.

The first step in understanding what you type is to know what language you typed. The developers could have gone the straightforward route — look at your language settings — but instead they went a step further: Fantastical detects the language based on what you actually typed.

This means your system could be set to French but you could type Spanish text and it will work.

I like this. The best Mac developers have been famous for taking the extra steps. Most people won’t need this — but those who do it will delight.
