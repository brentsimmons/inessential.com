Stephen Hargrove <a href="http://spiritofnine.com/posts/2012/01/16/site-rewrite-complete/">wrote his own static blog generator</a>: it uses Perl, Dropbox, AppleScript, Acorn, and Hazel — and it does a lot more than mine does.

I dig how it works. Stephen writes:

>So basically, my workflow is now this:
1. Write a post.
2. Rename the post with the ".markdown" extension.
3. Check my iPhone when the notification comes in to see the post was successfully made.
