I got on the <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a> bandwagon about 24 hours ago — and I like it so far. I haven’t investigated it in any deep way. I’ve just installed a few small things. But it’s simple and it works.

The most recent thing I installed was <a href="https://github.com/dhess/contacts/">contacts</a> (which is useful to connect mutt to the OS X Address Book). I could have cloned the repository and built it — but it was so easy to do <code>brew install contacts</code> that I did it that way. And I feel fine about it.

How does that set Homebrew apart from <a href="http://www.finkproject.org/">Fink</a> and <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>? It may not be that much different — but it feels more modern and less fiddly. Installing was simple. Use is simple. It’s git-based. Formulas are Ruby scripts. There’s no weird <code>/opt</code> folder.

Bonus: it has a delightful typo on the home page, where it says that “Homebrew *compliments* OS X.” (Italics mine.) I know that *complements* was meant, but the typo made me think that Homebrew is a nice, polite young person who compliments their elders. Why not?

(I hope they never fix the typo.)
