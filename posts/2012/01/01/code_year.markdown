Learn how to code this year: <a href="http://codeyear.com/">Code Year</a>.

I think this is a fabulous idea. I almost wish I didn’t already know how to code so I could learn it for the first time.

Douglas Rushkoff is quoted on the site:

>If we don’t learn to program, we risk being programmed ourselves... <strong>program or be programmed</strong>.
