<a href="http://www.360macdev.com/">360MacDev</a> starts on Friday. It looks like tickets are still available and just $300.

I’m doing the keynote. Other speakers include Mike Lee, Dave Wiskus, Kyle Richter, Colin Donnell, Luc Vandal, and more really smart people. Here’s the <a href="http://www.360macdev.com/schedule/">schedule</a>.

This may be the only Mac-specific conference in the world! And I totally can’t wait. Mac apps rule. You should go.
