Lesson learned: <a href="http://collindonnell.com/blog/2012/1/4/essential-tools-2011.html">don’t tease Collin about his man-purse</a>, because he gets “crazy-touchy about it.” Got that? Don’t tease Collin about his man-purse. Do. Not. Do. It.

Good list. It includes <a href="http://markedapp.com/">Marked</a>, which I’ve recently started using too. I haven’t tried <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> yet — since <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html">LaunchBar</a> does exactly what I want. But I should give it a try.
