Running a search at Google was starting to feel like walking through a minefield. I’ve trained myself to be careful where I click, because I might step on a +1 explosive or get blown to bits by surprise double-chevrons.

But I still used Google search, because I trusted the search. <a href="http://searchengineland.com/examples-google-search-plus-drive-facebook-twitter-crazy-107554">Now I don’t</a>.

Losing trust of its users may be the worst thing a search engine can do.

I’m trying <a href="http://www.bing.com/">Bing</a>, which I never thought I’d do. It’s easy to switch: the search bar in Safari has a little menu where you can choose your search engine. You can switch back if you don’t like it.

I don’t trust Bing yet, but I don’t have a reason to distrust it, either.
