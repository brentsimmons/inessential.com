<a href="http://collindonnell.com/blog/2012/1/9/learn-and-work-hard.html">Collin Donnell</a>: “No one could tell me ‘no’…”

That’s the thing. If it weren’t for the web and software — if I had had to rely on somebody telling me “yes” to have a vocation — I’d still be a busboy.

(I was a great busboy, by the way. Detail-oriented, fast, and good at keeping the coffee cups full. Seattle-ites will recognize some of the places I worked: Trattoria Mitchelli, McCormick and Schmick’s, A-Jay’s, and <a href="http://www.anthonys.com/restaurants/detail/chinook-at-salmon-bay">Chinook’s</a>. Mostly Chinook’s. I loved coming home with actual cash every day.)
