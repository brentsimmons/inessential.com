My brother-in-law’s sister is doing a very awesome thing: the <a href="http://www.reve.cc/">Rêve tour</a>, which follows the same course as the Tour de France.

>In what we believe will be a first for women’s cycling, a team of six amateur women will take on the ultimate road cycling challenge of a complete grand tour. Starting in Liège one day ahead of the pro peloton our riders will complete the entire parcours of the 2012 Tour de France arriving in Paris on the 21st of July. In the process they’ll prove to themselves, other female cyclists, and women thinking about taking up the sport, that any bicycle dream is possible.
