The Cocoa Development board on Glassboard has a new invitation code: COCOA. (Case-insensitive.)

I have no idea if Glassboard is a good medium for these kinds of discussions. So we’ll find out. (I think the in-beta <a href="https://app.glassboard.com/">web app</a> helps, since we’re at our desks when coding, and since it’s tough to type coding questions on a phone.)
