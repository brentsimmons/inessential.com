There’s a <a href="http://random-ideas.net/nscoder/index.html">virtual NSCoder</a> night via Google+ Hangouts.

Quote to file under slightly-funny-sign-of-the-times:

>Sadly, because apparently humanity has reached the point where any public video conferencing service eventually devolves into Chat Roulette, we have to restrict access to these sessions. We do this by having a special circle of friends with whom the hangout session is shared each week.

>This doesn’t mean that we restrict access to anyone with a legitimate interest in Objective-C. We do this simply to keep the signal-to-penis ratio up.
