John Scalzi explains <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/07/26/who-gets-to-be-a-geek-anyone-who-wants-to-be/">who gets to be a geek</a> (anybody) and the difference between geeks and hipsters:

>Many people believe geekdom is defined by a love of a thing, but I think — and my experience of geekdom bears on this thinking — that the true sign of a geek is a delight in sharing a thing. It’s the major difference between a geek and a hipster, you know: When a hipster sees someone else grooving on the thing they love, their reaction is to say “Oh, <em>crap</em>, now the <em>wrong people</em> like the thing I love.”
