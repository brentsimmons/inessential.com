In an interview with Business Insider, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ex-apple-employee-reveals-the-biggest-complaints-developers-have-about-working-with-apple-2012-7?op=1">Mike lists some complaints</a>. The one I think is most important: “iOS developers feel completely cut off from their customers.”

Mike:

>If I have a customer who is unhappy with my app for any reason, the customer should be able to write me telling me they have a problem. And if somebody doesn’t like my app, I should be able to give them their money back.
