I’ve never seen an app go so dramatically bad as the latest update of <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scrabble/id284815117?mt=8">Scrabble for iPhone</a>. (Don’t get it; don’t update if you have an earlier version.)

It had an average four-star rating across all versions. But look at the ratings for the current release.

The new version feels like a UIWebView app — that is, I think it’s mostly HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The old version — which wasn’t perfect, but was playable and fun — felt like a native iPhone app.

I’m tempted to say that there’s a truth here, that UIWebView-based apps always suck. But I’m not sure that that’s really the problem — the problem is that it’s a really, really sucky UIWebView-based app.

The biggest issue is that the main game play is super-difficult. It’s hard to read and hard to manipulate.

I would *love* to write a Scrabble game for people who love Scrabble. Get a great designer who loves words (<a href="http://mrgan.tumblr.com">Neven Mrgan</a> would be choice one). Imagine how awesome it could be! But I’m not going to write that game, or any other.

In the meantime, I wish I could give this version zero stars.

It’s the only iPhone game I play.

(Commence the sighing.)
