Scotty and John Fox were nice to include an NSBabble of other developer-podcasters — me, Saul Mora, Guy English, and Manton Reece — in the latest episode: <a href="http://blog.ideveloper.tv/podcast76/">The Christmas Special</a>.

Thrill to the dulcet tones of Saul Mora! Be amazed by the power of Manton’s explosive insights! Try to remain sane as Guy proves just how awesome he is!
