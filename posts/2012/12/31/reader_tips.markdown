NSHipster published a nice set of <a href="http://nshipster.com/reader-submissions-new-years-2013/">reader submissions</a>. My favorite is the reminder about Xcode snippets â€” I keep forgetting that feature exists. (Though I do wish we also had the ability to write scripts. I miss that feature from Xcode 3.)
