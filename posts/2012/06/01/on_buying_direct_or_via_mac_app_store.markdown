>Apple now only accepts sandboxed Mac apps, clarifying the situation: customers should buy Mac apps directly unless there’s a good reason not to.

Wolf argues that sandboxing tips the scales in favor of buying direct.

I have to admit that I remain worried about sandboxing. I find myself discarding good ideas for apps just because of sandboxing rules. That can’t be a good thing for the platform.

And so I take a wait-and-see approach — don’t start any new Mac apps. Which also can’t be good.
