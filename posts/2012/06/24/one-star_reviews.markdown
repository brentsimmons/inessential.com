John Scalzi quotes a few <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/06/19/and-now-some-one-star-reviews-of-redshirts/">one-star reviews of Redshirts</a>, his latest bestseller. (Which I haven’t read yet, but is on my list.) And he says:

>I think as a creator you owe your audience your best efforts, but if at the end of your best effort some of them are still not happy, the best response is, <em>oh, well, maybe next time</em>. You will never make everyone happy. If you try, you’ll likely create something mediocre, and then nobody will be happy. Least of all you.

Applies to app developers too.

If God Himself made The Greatest and Most Wonderful App Ever, it would still get a bunch of one-star reviews. And if it was $0.99 there would be people bitching about the price.
