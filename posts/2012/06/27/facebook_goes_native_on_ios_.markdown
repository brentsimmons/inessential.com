<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/27/facebook-plans-to-speedup-its-iphone-app/">The New York Times reports</a> that Facebook’s iPhone app will go more Objective-C and less HTML5 in an upcoming release.

>I had the opportunity to see the as-yet unreleased iPhone application, and it is fast. Blazing fast.

Any one of us could have told them to start with Objective-C in the first place.

(I like HTML5 — but it’s not the right tool for every job.)
