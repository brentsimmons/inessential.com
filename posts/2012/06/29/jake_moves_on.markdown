My friend <a href="http://www.jakesavin.com/2012/06/29">Jake Savin</a> is leaving Microsoft.

>It’s hard to imagine today, but when I started my tech career as a test engineer, a really big hard disk held 4GB of data and cost around $1000, and the Web was still booting up. The entire company I worked for then had less storage capacity than some of us now carry with them in their laptops. When I started at Microsoft, Vista hadn’t shipped yet, Nokia, Palm and RIM were the mobile computing kings, there was no iPhone, no Android, and no Kindle, and tablet computing required a stylus.

Time.

Jake and I worked together at UserLand Software in the late ’90s and early ’00s. A few years ago he moved to the Seattle area — which means we hang out a lot more than when we were co-workers, which is cool.
