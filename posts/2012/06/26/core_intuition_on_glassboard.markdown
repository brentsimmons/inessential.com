Manton Reece’s and Daniel Jalkut’s very cool <a href="http://www.coreint.org/">Core Intuition podcast</a> now has a <a href="http://glassboard.com/">Glassboard</a> board. The invitation code is COREINT.

Note that it has a custom invitation code. We set those up manually. If you have a podcast and would like a board (for listener questions, feedback, DVD extras, whatever) with a custom invitation code, get in touch with me.
