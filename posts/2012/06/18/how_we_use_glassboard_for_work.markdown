Last week was WWDC, which I missed this year — which meant that I was home working on <a href="http://glassboard.com/">Glassboard</a> while my friends at the conference were using the app to figure out where to eat lunch and which parties to attend.

I had fun watching. I could live vicariously while I was otherwise just working. (Shields! No, Chieftain!)

While Glassboard is useful for conferences — huge thanks to everyone who gave it a go at WWDC! — it’s even more useful for day-to-day <em>work</em>. We’ve been using it inside Sepia Labs for over a year now, since the very first moment it was usable at all. We use Glassboard to make Glassboard.

We’ve found that the social-networking-like model — messages, comments, pictures, videos, likes, shared files, locations — works great for work, for getting things done as a team.

We hardly use email at all any more. (Especially now that there’s a <a href="http://app.glassboard.com/">web app</a>. It may still be in beta, but it works.)

Jenny <a href="http://glassboard.com/blog/2012/06/18/the-future-of-working-together/">posted a thing to the Glassboard blog</a> (that I had written on a Glassboard board) with some more details about how we use it for work. If you have any questions, please feel free to <a href="http://twitter.com/brentsimmons">ask me on Twitter</a> or on the inessential board in Glassboard. (Invitation code: rovhy.)
