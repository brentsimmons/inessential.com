Here’s the explanation:

In 1995 I went indie. My company was called World Wide Power & Light. (Another company already  had a similar name, so we renamed the company to Ranchero Software later in 1996. In those days all the cool domain names ended with a vowel: Tango, Marimba, etc.)

Our first main product was a search engine CGI for Macs running WebSTAR (originally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacHTTP">MacHTTP</a>). It glued together <a href="http://frontiernews.wordpress.com/">Frontier</a> and <a href="http://www.filemaker.com/">Filemaker Pro</a> to index files on the hard drive and make them searchable.

The price was $99 and we sold 9 copies.

The plaque is from Apple and signed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi_Roizen">Heidi Roizen</a> (formerly of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T/Maker">T/Maker</a>; then VP of Apple Developer Relations). I’ve never seen any other plaques like this, so I don’t know how many they gave out.

But I was brand-new to all this, and I loved it.

(It looks like our <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19991021212201/http://www.ranchero.com/spotlight/">product page</a> is still on the Wayback Machine.)

Update 4:05 pm: Yes, our search engine was called Spotlight. This was long before there was a Spotlight feature on Macs.
