I’ve always liked this Flaubert quote:

>Be regular and orderly in your life like a bourgeois, so that you may be violent and original in your work.

I like this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-LFd-PQd6E">Charlie Rose interview with Lou Reed and Laurie Anderson from 2003</a>. Here’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQWiyKtMemo">part two</a>.

Among a bunch of other things, they talk about making their art simpler. But I especially love the exchange starting about 4:30 into part two.

“Everybody we know,” says Lou.

“Works,” says Laurie.
