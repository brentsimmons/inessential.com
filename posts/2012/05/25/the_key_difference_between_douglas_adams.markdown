I’m sure this has been noted — but I don’t know who to credit.

Both Douglas Adams and Monty Python have been noted for their sense of the absurdity of life. The difference is that for Adams there is always an answer — and even a question — underneath all the absurdity. It’s hidden and it may be deeply strange, but it’s ultimately knowable.

But for Monty Python it’s absurd all the way down.

If we geeks had theological debates, I think this would be our debate.
