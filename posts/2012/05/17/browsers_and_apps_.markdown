>It seems very likely to me that there’s something simple and beautiful lurking inside the browser platform that will hit the greatest 80/20 point in software history. But I’ve been thinking that for a decade or more, now.

Because I’m a Cocoa developer you might (might) assume I’m a partisan in a browser vs. apps war. But I’m not, and I think it’s an imaginary war. (I spent a couple months working on websites around the beginning of this year. And enjoyed it.)

I do think that Tim’s right when he says it’s complicated and there are reasons to use and not-use both.

It also seems as if partisans tend to assume that the other technology is standing still. It’s not.
