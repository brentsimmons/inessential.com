I wrote about a <a href="http://inessential.com/2012/05/22/hiding_the_last_app">thing that bugged me</a> — and Daniel Jalkut <a href="https://gist.github.com/2773193">wrote an AppleScript</a> that solved the problem for me.

I put the script into <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/">FastScripts</a> (Daniel’s product, which I use every day) and gave the script a cmd-H keystroke — and it works. Problem solved!
