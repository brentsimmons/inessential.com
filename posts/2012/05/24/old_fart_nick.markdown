One thing I love about my company of six people: three are over 40, and the youngest is 30. (Nick is the oldest by about 10 months.)

I prefer working with software veterans â€” they have more and better scars and lessons learned from those scars.

(Metaphor switch alert.) Have you ever drawn with charcoal? You know how you use your fingers to smudge the lines to get things to look good?

New developers are those crisp and clean lines. Veteran developers have been smudged just right.
