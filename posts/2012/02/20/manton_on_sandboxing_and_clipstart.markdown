<a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/02/sandboxing_and_clipstart.html">Manton Reece</a> on pulling Clipstart from the Mac App Store due to sandboxing:

>Maybe I could file bugs with Apple for exemptions, and reduce the functionality of my app to fit within the limits of the sandbox, but Iâ€™ve made the decision that it is just not worth it. I would much rather spend 100% of the time I have for Clipstart on new features only, not playing catch-up with Apple.
