A <a href="https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb">new version of FMDB</a> is out. I haven’t used this new version yet, but I will. The new version supports ARC and not-ARC and is block-savvy.

I use FMDB in everything. I sprinkle it on my Raisin Bran in the morning. It’s the secret spice in my Bloody Marias.
