<a href="http://boredzo.org/blog/archives/2012-02-17/xcode-and-friends">Peter Hosey</a> explains where everything is now.

I wasn’t going to download Xcode 4.3 today because I didn’t feel like I have the capacity to go through and figure out what just happened. But Peter’s list explains it, and now I have no fear.

Or, I still have fear, but it’s just the usual fear of developer-tool-change — which is still significant. Imagine you’re a carpenter who gets a new hammer every few months. It’s always a little different: the grip is more sticky; it weighs a little more at the top; it doesn’t swing exactly like it used to.

But the old hammer won’t work on the new nails, so you need to use the new hammer. The new hammer’s probably better, but it’s still an adjustment.
