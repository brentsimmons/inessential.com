I didn’t know about Saul Mora’s <a href="http://nsbrief.com/">NSBrief podcast</a> until he interviewed me at 360MacDev. It’s possible I’m the last person to know.

Recent interviews have included not just me but smart folks like Chris Adamson and Tom Harrington.

(And, yes, I do have a pinky ring — gold, with two diamonds and my initials. It’s just a family thing.)

<i>Update 2:30 pm</i>: I say something on the podcast about having bad luck with designers. That’s an exaggeration — and sometimes I’ve had a great time working with designers and the result was something I loved. (NetNewsWire for iPad with <a href="http://www.halfapixelshort.com/">Brad Ellis</a> was especially cool.) If I haven’t always had the outcome I wanted, then that points to me not knowing how to work with designers — it should not reflect on the designers.
