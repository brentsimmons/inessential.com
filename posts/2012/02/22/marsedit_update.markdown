It’s a <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/2355/marsedit-3-4-3-compatibility-fixes">small update</a> — some compatibility fixes — but I’ll take any opportunity to say how much I love MarsEdit. I do. A lot.

My blog doesn’t have any other dedicated UI. Just MarsEdit. I wrote my blog system knowing I’d  use MarsEdit — it wasn’t even a question.
