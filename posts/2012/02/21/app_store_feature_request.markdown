I’ve often wished that I could make a for-pay app free to all Apple employees. I don’t know if Apple’s system knows who’s an Apple employee or not — it might be difficult to implement.

But if there was a checkbox on the thing where we upload apps that says “Make this free to all Apple employees,” I’d check Yes every time.
