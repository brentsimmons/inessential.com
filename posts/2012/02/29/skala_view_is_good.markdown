I linked to <a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2012/02/11/skala-preview-lets-you-see-your-ios-designs-instantly-on-your-iphone-or-ipad/">Skala View</a> when it first came out. Since then I’ve been using it all day every day.

Here’s what’s great about it: it connects directly to Photoshop CS5. Make a change in Photoshop and it appears on the phone.

I often work this way: my right hand is on my computer’s trackpad; my left hand holds my phone. As I make changes with my right hand, I watch what happens on the phone.

I feel like I should buy the app again every morning.
