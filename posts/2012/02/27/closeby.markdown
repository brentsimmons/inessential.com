My friend Collin Donnell just shipped <a href="http://collindonnell.com/blog/2012/2/27/closeby-10.html">Closeby 1.0</a>, an app that “uses your address book to tell you how far you are from people you’ve saved addresses for.”

It sounds like Find My Friends, but it’s different — it tells you how far you are from where you friends live, based on the entry you have for them in Contacts.
