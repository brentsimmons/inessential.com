1. Splitview resizing</p>

<p>Open Mail. Resize the window via the resize-thing at the bottom right corner of the window.</p>

<p>Note that the width of the source list (mailboxes and things) on the left stays at a constant width as you resize the window. (Same is true in iTunes and iPhoto. Colloquy and Coda. Etc.)</p>

<p>Note <em>also</em> that the horizontal splitter stays in the same place — the message view shrinks and grows, but the splitter stays in the same place.</p>

<p>It gives a feeling of physical stability, I think. For a counter-example, try Safari’s bookmarks manager — the source list on the left does not stay at a constant width as you resize the window. And it feels a little weird.</p>

<p>2. Source list x origin</p>

<p>Consider this detail from Mail’s source list:</p>

<p><img src="http://inessential.com/images/sourceListMailDetail.png" alt="Mail’s source list" width="15" height="33" /></p>

<p>Now consider this from an app made by an independent developer:</p>

<p><img src="http://inessential.com/images/sourceListOtherDetail.png" alt="______’s source list" width="15" height="33" /></p>

<p>Set aside that the second app isn’t using the source list background color or selection gradient — note the extra outline between the selection and the window border.</p>

<p>Here they are blown up, so you can see what I’m talking about:</p>

<p><img src="http://inessential.com/images/sourceListMailDetailBlownup.png" alt="Mail’s source list blown up" width="45" height="100" /></p>

<p><img src="http://inessential.com/images/sourceListOtherDetailBlownup.png" alt="______’s source list blown up" width="55" height="114" /></p>

<p>Here’s the secret: the x origin for the source list needs to be -1, not 0, to hide that outline. (Or maybe you can set it not to be bordered, or whatever — as long as that outline doesn’t show.)
