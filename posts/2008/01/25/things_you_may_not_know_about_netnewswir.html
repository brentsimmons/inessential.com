Every time we do a new release of NetNewsWire we get new users and a ton of feedback.</p>

<p>With the 3.1 release this was a bit more than normal because, well, it’s free now, and because we actually open a page in NetNewsWire where we ask people for feedback. (The page opens automatically, just once, two weeks after running NetNewsWire the first time.)</p>

<p>I spent a couple hours today reading some of this feedback, and realized it’s time to do a few posts on things you may not know about NetNewsWire. (By the way, reading feedback is pretty fun. Folks are nice. ;)
</p>
<h4>It plays video and Flash</h4>
<p>
The most common feature request in the feedback I read today is that NetNewsWire should play video, Flash, YouTube, etc.</p>

<p>It does. It’s turned off by default, but it’s easy to turn on.</p>

<p>Open <span class="uiname">Preferences</span>, click <span class="uiname">Browsing</span>. Click the <span class="uiname">News Items</span> tab—to enable Flash and video, make sure the box next to <span class="uiname">Enable plug-ins</span> is checked.</p>

<p>Click the <span class="uiname">Web Pages</span> tab and repeat to do the same thing for web pages.</p>

<p>A couple things to know, though:</p>

<p>1. On some machines, you may have to enable plug-ins for both news items and web pages in order to make them work in web pages.</p>

<p>2. Plug-ins are off by default because they’re unstable and eat lots of memory. (Flash in particular.) So if you run into memory or crashing issues, the first thing to try is turning off plug-ins.
</p>
<h4>You can open tabs in the background</h4>
<p>
When you open the page for a news item, the page opens in front, by default. Lots of people have asked (in the feedback) for a way to make the tab open in the background instead.</p>

<p>Here’s how:</p>

<p>Open <span class="uiname">Preferences</span>, click <span class="uiname">Browsing</span>, click the <span class="uiname">Behavior</span> tab (if necessary), and <em>uncheck</em> the box next to <span class="uiname">Select new tabs as they are created</span>.</p>

<p>If you use an external browser instead of NetNewsWire’s browser, you can tell it to open links in the browser in the background. Check the box next to <span class="uiname">Open links in background.</span>
</p>
<h4>It’s super-easy to go from a web page back to the News Items tab</h4>
<p>
Hit the \\ key.
</p>
<h4>You can have traditional browser tabs—tabs across the top—instead of vertical tabs</h4>
<p>
Some people prefer browser tabs across the top—horizontal, no thumbnails. It’s easy to do: choose <span class="uiname">Tab > Position Tabs on Top</span>.</p>

<p>To go back to vertical tabs, choose <span class="uiname">Tab > Position Tabs on Right</span>.
</p>
<h4>You can hide the subscriptions list when reading a web page</h4>
<p>
There’s not a lot of room to read web pages when you have the subscriptions list showing and vertical tabs. You can tell NetNewsWire to hide the subscriptions list when a web page is showing: choose <span class="uiname">View > Automatically Hide Subscriptions List</span>.</p>

<p>(This is what I do, by the way. A personal favorite feature.)
</p>
<h4>You can make text bigger/smaller</h4>
<p>
We don’t have toolbar commands for making text bigger and smaller, but we do have menu commands. See <span class="uiname">View > Make Text Bigger</span> and <span class="uiname">View > Make Text Smaller</span>. They even have the standard keyboard shortcuts.
</p>
<h4>You can close all your tabs</h4>
<p>Choose <span class="uiname">Tab > Close All Tabs</span>.
</p>
<h4>You can do a linkdump of your tabs</h4>
<p>
If you want to post all your tabs to your weblog, or just save them on disk (perhaps to email to somebody), you can. See <span class="uiname">Tab > Post Tabs to Weblog</span> and <span class="uiname">Tab > Export Tabs</span>.
</p>
<h4>You can open a news item using the opposite of your prefs</h4>
<p>
If you normally open news items in NetNewsWire, but want to open it in your default browser instead, type option-return.</p>

<p>To open a link in an HTML view in your default browser: shift-click the link.
</p>
<h4>You can set font preferences for news items and web pages</h4>
<p>Open <span class="uiname">Preferences</span>, click <span class="uiname">Fonts</span>, click the <span class="uiname">News Items</span> tab, then set your preferences. Click the <span class="uiname">Web Pages</span> tab and do the same for web pages.</p>

<p>Note, however, that some styles may use a different font than your preference—just as some web pages do too.
</p>
<h4>You can easily switch from tab to tab</h4>
<p>
Type 9 to go up (or left) in the tabs list. Type 0 to go down (or right) in the tabs list.
</p>
<h4>You can open the current page in your default browser</h4>
<p>
If you’re reading a web page, and want to open it in your default external browser, type cmd-option-B. (Or pull down the gear menu and choose <span class="uiname">Open in Default Browser</span>.)
</p>
<h4>You can send a web page via email</h4>
<p>
Choose <span class="uiname">File > Mail Contents of this Page</span> or <span class="uiname">File > Mail Link to This Page</span>.
</p>
<h4>You can use commands like Post to Weblog, etc. on web pages</h4>
<p>They’re enabled for web pages as well as for news items.</p>
<h4>You can search for text on a web page</h4>
<p>It’s not that cool incremental search, but you can type cmd-F to do run the Find panel on a web page. (Obviously, of course, I want to do that cool Safari-like search.)
</p>
<h4>You can do a Google search</h4>
<p>In the address bar, type g followed by a space, followed by whatever you want to search for, as in <code>g iPhone SDK</code>. Then hit return.
Or use the search field in the toolbar—click the triangle to pull down the list of search options. (Not intended as a <a href="http://wafflesoftware.net/monocle/">Monocle</a> replacement, however. ;)
</p>
<h4>You can subscribe to feeds linked-to from a web page</h4>
<p>
When viewing a web page, to the right of the address bar is a bluish RSS icon—it’s a popup menu. Click on it to choose a feed from the page to subscribe to.</p>

<p>(It’s disabled when NetNewsWire doesn’t detect any feeds linked-to from the page.)</p>
