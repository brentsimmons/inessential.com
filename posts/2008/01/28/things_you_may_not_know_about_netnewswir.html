More stuff you may not know about NetNewsWire (also see <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=3466">part one</a>)...
</p>
<h4>Space bar</h4>
<p>The easiest way to read your news is to hit the space bar—in fact, it’s the only key you need.</p>

<p>The space bar scrolls the current item. If there is no more to scroll, it goes to the next unread item. This way you can read all of your news with coffee cup in one hand, while the other taps the space bar.
</p>
<h4>Flag/unflag using the f key</h4>
<p>Type the f key to flag an item. Type it again to unflag the item.</p>
<h4>List of single-key shortcuts</h4>
<p>You can see a list of single-key shortcuts by choosing <span class="uiname">Help > Keyboard Shortcuts</span>. There are a bunch of them. (They’re not customizable yet, but that’s on the to-do list for the future.)</p>
<h4>You <em>can</em> go back</h4>
<p>If you want to go back to the previous news item, you can: type cmd-[. Or choose <span class="uiname">Go > Back</span>. You can even add Forward and Back buttons (a la Safari) to the toolbar: choose <span class="uiname">View > Customize Toolbar</span>.</p>
<h4>Multiple selection</h4>
<p>You can select multiple news items—and flag them or whatever. You can open their links all at once—just hit return or right arrow. (To open using the opposite of your prefs—to open in your external browser if you normally open in NetNewsWire—hold down the option key.)</p>

<p>There’s a limit (20, I think), so you won’t accidentally try to open 1000 items at once.
</p>
<h4>You can navigate using arrow keys</h4>
<p>NetNewsWire is unique as far as I know in that you can navigate between the subscriptions list and headlines list using the arrow keys. When in subscriptions, use right arrow to go to the headlines list. When in the headlines list, use left arrow to go back to the subscriptions list.</p>
<h4>Page-up/page-down works on description view</h4>
<p>When the headlines list (in widescreen or traditional view) has focus, then the page-up/page-down keys scroll the description view up and down. (Just like Mail.)</p>
<h4>Set font settings</h4>
<p>You can change a bunch of font and color settings: open <span class="uiname">Preferences</span>, then see the <span class="uiname">Colors</span> and <span class="uiname">Fonts</span> panes. (Note: some style sheets may over-ride font settings. Not all do, but some do.)</p>
<h4>You can make text bigger/smaller</h4>
<p>The make text bigger/smaller commands (see the <span class="uiname">View</span> menu) work on the description view (as well as on web pages).</p>
<h4>Widescreen users: how to save space</h4>
<p>If you use the widescreen view, you can stack the headlines view: instead of multiple columns, the dateline appears below the title. Choose <span class="uiname">View > Layout > Show Datelines</span>.</p>

<p>If you also want to see the first line of text, choose <span class="uiname">View > Layout > Show Summaries Below Title</span>.</p>
<h4>Show summaries in-line</h4>
<p>Best when used with traditional view: <span class="uiname">View > Layout > Show Summaries In-line</span>.</p>
<h4>Find in the description view</h4>
<p>If you want to find text in the description view, click on the view to give it focus (or navigate there using Tab), then type cmd-F. (It’s not cool like Safari’s find, I know, but it works. No need to make a feature request to make it cooler. ;)</p>
<h4>Easy expand/collapse in Combined View</h4>
<p>To collapse the current news item, hit the , key. To expand, hit the . key.</p>

<p>To collapse all, hit the ; key. To expand all, hit the &#039; key.</p>

<p>(Note: these same shortcuts work in the subscriptions list and Sites Drawer.)</p>
<h4>Select text before post-to-weblog</h4>
<p>If you want to quote part of a news item, select the text you want to quote in the description view, then choose <span class="uiname">News > Post to Weblog</span>.</p>
<h4>Change the look</h4>
<p>If you use traditional or widescreen view, there’s a popup menu at the bottom-right of the window where you can choose a different style.</p>

<p>You can find more styles (beyond just what ships with the app) by going to the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/resources/styles.php">NetNewsWire Styles</a> page.</p>
