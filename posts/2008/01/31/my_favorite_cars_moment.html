My favorite <a href="http://www.crazyapplerumors.com/">CARS</a> moment—that’s Crazy Apple Rumors Site, but it’s too late to learn that—is probably the announcement that it’s going on hiatus, because <em>now I can finally get some goddamn work done</em>.</p>

<p>Or maybe it was <a href="http://www.crazyapplerumors.com/?p=580">one</a> <a href="http://www.crazyapplerumors.com/?p=162">of</a> <a href="http://www.crazyapplerumors.com/?p=707">the</a> <a href="http://www.crazyapplerumors.com/?p=416">times</a> I was in it. ;)</p>

<p>But, really, I have no idea what to say, other than it’s been the only rumors site that speaks the truth—and I love it and will miss it. <a href="http://www.moltz.net/~john/blog/">John Moltz</a> deserves a huge round of applause. And like a gold watch or something. And sexbots of his very own. ;)</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> More applause from <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/posts/News/CARS-2008-01-31-21-00">Rogue Amoeba</a> and <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2008/01/31/cars-on-hiatus-and-a-favorite-cars-moment/">TUAW</a>. And <a href="http://gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2008/01/my_favorite_cars_moment.html">Gus</a>. (There will be more. ;)
