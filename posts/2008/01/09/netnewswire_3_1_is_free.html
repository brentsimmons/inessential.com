NetNewsWire 3.1 is free!</p>

<p>By <em>free</em> I mean both that we’ve released it from its cage and that it <em>costs no money</em>. Zero dollars.</p>

<p>Upgrades are free. It’s free for new users. It’s freeware.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/">download it</a> right away. Here are the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire3.1.php">change notes</a>.</p>

<p>NetNewsWire is not alone—we’ve also made <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/FeedDemon/">FeedDemon</a>, <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NewsGatorInbox/">NewsGator Inbox</a>, and <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NewsGatorGo/">NewsGator Go!</a> free.</p>

<p>Why go free? <a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2008/01/free-demon-yes.html">Nick Bradbury</a> and <a href="http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/2008/01/09/newsgators-rss-clients-are-now-free/">Greg Reinacker</a> explain it better than I would, but it boils down to this: the software is great marketing for our enterprise software; and the more users we have, the better able we are to calculate relevance and importance.</p>

<p>I dream of being able to make it so you spend less time reading stuff you don’t care about—I want the important news to go right to the top.</p>

<p>There’s a <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/CompanyInfo/FreeClientFAQ.aspx">FAQ</a> that explains a bunch of things—I’m not going to repeat it all here.</p>

<p>But I will say that, for me personally, this is a dream come true. Every developer wants to be able to work on the software they love, make a living at it, <i>and</i> give it to the world for free.</p>

<p>Usually you get to pick two out of three—if you’re lucky. Me, I get all three.
