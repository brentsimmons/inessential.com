When I was at Macworld I had the pleasure of doing an <a href="http://www.yourmaclifeshow.com/content/netnewswire-elements-6-macspeech’s-dictation">interview with Shawn King</a> in the fishbowl-ish thing on the show floor.</p>

<p>But if you’re only going to listen to one podcast today, listen to <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2008/01/23/macbreak-74">MacBreak Weekly 74: Hot Lips and Hawkeye</a>, for the talk about MacHeist.
