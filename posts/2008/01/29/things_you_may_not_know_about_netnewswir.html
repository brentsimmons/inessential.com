More stuff you may not know about NetNewsWire (also see parts <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=3466">one</a> and <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=3472">two</a>)...
</p>
<h4>Choose to sync or not at subscribe time</h4>
<p>If you use NewsGator syncing, you can choose whether or not to sync a feed when you’re subscribing. There’s a <span class="uiname">Sync this feed</span> checkbox on the subscribe sheet.</p>

<p>(Note: there ought to be a way to change your mind later. There isn’t, yet, but it’s on the to-do list.)</p>
<h4>Big list of built-in feeds</h4>
<p>NetNewsWire comes with a categorized list of feeds you can subscribe to. Choose <span class="uiname">View > Show Sites Drawer</span> to see it. Lots of great stuff in there.</p>
<h4>Cmd-F does a Find</h4>
<p>To do a find in the subscriptions list or Sites Drawer, type cmd-F to open the Find panel. (Sure, I’d like a filter-style find—it’s on the to-do list too.)</p>
<h4>Easy expand/collapse folder(s)</h4>
<p>Collapse a folder: , key. Expand a folder: . key. Collapse all folders: ; key. Expand all folders: &#039; key.</p>
<h4>Sort feeds</h4>
<p>You can sort feeds by name, unread count, attention, or last update. Or you can organize them manually. See <span class="uiname">View > Sort Subscriptions By</span>.</p>

<p>Sorting is animated. You can turn off animation. You can also tell it to sort only inside folders, but leave the top level organized manually.</p>
<h4>Validate feed</h4>
<p>To validate a feed, select it, then pull down the gear menu (lower-left corner of the window) and choose Validate this Feed.</p>
<h4>Per-feed settings</h4>
<p>There are a bunch of things you can set on a per-feed and per-folder basis. Select a subscription, then type cmd-I (or choose <span class="uiname">Window > Info</span>).</p>
<h4>Select multiple feeds</h4>
<p>If you select multiple feeds, all the news items from those feeds will be listed in the headlines view.</p>
<h4>Contextual menus</h4>
<p>You can ctrl-click (or right-click) on a subscription to get a contextual menu.</p>
<h4>Search engine feeds, tag feeds</h4>
<p>To subscribe to a search engine or tag feeds, see the <span class="uiname">File > New Special Subscription</span> menu. Search engine feeds are great if you want to see all mentions of a certain keyword on the web. (For instance, you might watch for feedback about your product.) Tag feeds are similar, but follow tags—for instance, you might like Paris, and so you subscribe to a feed that shows all pictures posted to Flickr with the tag Paris.</p>
<h4>Easy unsubscribing</h4>
<p>Select a subscription and hit the Delete key to unsubscribe.</p>
<h4>Turn on/off Latest News, Flagged Items, and Clippings display</h4>
<p>You can show or not show each of the Latest News, Flagged Items, and Clippings subscriptions—see <span class="uiname">View > Show Latest News Subscription</span> and similar.</p>
<h4>Don’t read the brown feeds</h4>
<p>If a feed turns brown, that means it hasn’t updated in a couple months. You might want to unsubcribe from it. You can find other non-updating feeds: see <span class="uiname">Window > Dinosaurs</span>.</p>
<h4>Turn on/off icons and favicons</h4>
<p>You can turn off the display of icons and favicons in the subscriptions list: see the <span class="uiname">View > Subscriptions</span> menu.</p>
<h4>Subs status view</h4>
<p>The rectangle button at the very bottom-left of the window opens and closes the NewsGator-News/Thumbnail view. The gear menu is a contextual menu for the selected subscription. The status view (the bit with the text) changes what it displays if you click on it. (Probably should be a popup menu instead.) While downloading, you can click on the status view to open the Activity window.</p>

<p>You can also open the Activity window via <span class="uiname">Window > Activity</span>.
