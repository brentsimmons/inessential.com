There are a few things that have confused me all my life. One is the issue of higher numbers.
</p>
<p>
By that I mean — which number is higher, 1 or 2? 10 or 7?
</p>
<p>
I always get it wrong. Here’s why:
</p>
<p>
1. Here is a list.
</p>
<p>
2. Here’s a second item.
</p>
<p>
3. Here’s a third item.
</p>
<p>
Which number is higher? #1, clearly, is higher — it’s above the subsequent numbers. Just look at it — it’s totally, obviously, unquestionably higher.
</p>
<p>
But no. Everyone else thinks the other way. Despite the clear evidence of their eyes.
