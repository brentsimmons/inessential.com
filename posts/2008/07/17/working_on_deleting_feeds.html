Another NetNewsWire for iPhone progress report...
</p>
<p>
I’ve been working on NetNewsWire 1.0.6 since yesterday. The main new feature in 1.0.6 will be deleting feeds. When you delete a feed, you have two options of how to delete it:
</p>
<p>
1. Don’t Show in iPhone — removes it from your iPhone location, but leaves it intact in other places
</p>
<p>
2. Unsubscribe Everywhere
</p>
<p>
I thought about just doing #1 — but I think it would seem weird not to be able to unsubscribe from a feed completely, so I’m doing both.
</p>
<p>
And then, of course, there are still more bug fixes and some new features to do. Work continues, as always.
</p>
<p>
PS Had a root canal yesterday. I like joking that — given the amount of stress I’m in waiting for my updates to appear on the App Store — the couple hours lying down in the dentist’s chair was a nice, relaxing break. ;)
