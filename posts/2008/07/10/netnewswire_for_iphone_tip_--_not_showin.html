If there are some feeds you don’t want to see on NetNewsWire for iPhone, but you still want them to appear in the desktop version, here’s what to do:
</p>
<p>
1. Go to the <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/ngs/subscriber/webed2.aspx">browser-based reader</a> (sign if needed) then click on <strong>Settings</strong> (in the blue bar, upper right).
</p>
<p>
2. Then click on the <strong>Edit Locations</strong> tab.
</p>
<p>
3. Scroll down till you see the <strong>NetNewsWire iPhone/iPod-Touch</strong> location. Then click on <strong>Feeds</strong>.
</p>
<p>
4. Uncheck the ones you don’t want to see on your iPhone. Then click <strong>Update</strong> at the bottom of the screen.
</p>
<p>
(Obviously, it would be nice to be able to do this more easily through the iPhone. It’s on the to-do list.)
