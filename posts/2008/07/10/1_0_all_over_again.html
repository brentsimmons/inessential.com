Awesome day! <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWireiPhone/Default.aspx">NetNewsWire 1.0 for iPhone</a> is available via the App Store. (It’s featured, even.)
</p>
<p>
I’ve been checking out some other apps — so far I like Remote, Twitterrific, and Exposure. (There are plenty more apps to come, I’m sure. I know of some apps that aren’t listed yet that I’m eager to see.)
</p>

So much fun. Of course, I’ve already got 1.0.1 in the pipeline, and I’m working on 1.0.2. But for now I’m still checking out the App Store.
