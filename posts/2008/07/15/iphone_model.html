As a software developer, the one thing I’m good at is listening to users.
</p>
<p>
I’ve always worked in public or semi-public: release, listen to feedback, release, listen, repeat forever. I worked this way for years UserLand. All of NetNewsWire was developed this way, beginning with the very earliest betas of NetNewsWire Lite back in 2002.
</p>
<p>
My entire career has been about software development as social activity (and a little bit as public performance, I admit).
</p>
<p>
I don’t know another way to do this — and, if I did, that other way probably wouldn’t  suit my temperament. It may not be the best way to do software, but it’s the way that works for me.
</p>
<p>
Which is why I’m more than a little bit at sea with the iPhone development experience. Getting beta testers is a technical and <em>legal</em> challenge. And I’m used to having hundreds, not just a few. Discussing development and design issues with other developers is usually a valuable thing, but there’s an NDA in the way.
</p>
<p>
But, then, well, in theory I can do frequent public releases, get lots of feedback, and keep the cycle going. Great theory. Works for me!
</p>
<p>
Of course, that is, if I had a way to get my releases to the public... That’s where I’m bugged. I keep getting feedback on stuff I fixed or changed days ago. And no feedback on the recent changes.

Anyway, just thought I’d wave hi from out here on the waves.
