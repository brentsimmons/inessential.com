I’m working on NetNewsWire 3.2 for Macintosh (and also still working on the iPhone version, worry not). Part of planning is figuring out what features I can <em>delete</em>.
</p>
<p>
Deleting features has always been a big part of the way I work on NetNewsWire — in some ways, it’s my favorite part, since clutter is the death of software.
</p>
<p>
(Recall that NetNewsWire 1.x included an outliner and a weblog editor! The outliner got deleted, and the weblog editor got split out into MarsEdit — which, by the way, has a <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/532/marsedit-22">cool new release</a> today. And plenty of other features have been deleted along the way.)

<p>
Today I sent an email to my beta testers list with my ideas for features to delete. I welcome feedback, of course — agreements, disagreements, and other ideas for features to delete — though I don’t have time to reply. (I have to spend my time working on the software itself, rather than emailing about it. ;)
</p>
<p>
Here’s the list:
</p>
<p>
- Microformats (I bet I could delete them and no one would notice)
</p>
<p>
- Automatic enclosure downloading -- nuke it (use iTunes!)
</p>
<p>
- Full Screen command
</p>
<p>
- Sites Drawer
</p>
<p>
- FTP syncing (already deprecated)
</p>
<p>
- Sort (news items) by Arrival Order (it&#039;s weird, because there&#039;s no Arrival Order column, and sort by Date is already the default)
</p>
<p>
- Remove ability to turn on/off icons and favicons in subs list (they&#039;d always show)
</p>
<p>
- Remove ability to turn on/off sort animating in subs list (animating would be on)
</p>
<p>
- Remove ability to show/hide styles menu (it would always show)
</p>
<p>
- Remove Add Author to Address Book (which I bet nobody uses)
</p>
<p>
- Remove subfolder for each feed option in Downloading prefs; don&#039;t make "NetNewsWire Enclosures" folder -- people complain about both, so I&#039;d just make it flat
</p>
<p>
- Remove Combined View&#039;s "Collapse read items at startup" pref -- it would be on, no way to turn it off
</p>
<p>
- Remove the weird pref for "When going to next and previous unread items" -- it would always "Respect expansion state of the Subscriptions List"
</p>
<p>
- Remove the HTML News Archive feature -- which I bet nobody uses
</p>
