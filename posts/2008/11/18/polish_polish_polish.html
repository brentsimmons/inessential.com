I’ve been working heavily and steadily on iPhone code lately, and it occurs to me that writing iPhone apps is like writing poetry while writing desktop apps is like writing prose.
</p>
<p>
I’m sure it’s been said before, but the point is still good: in an iPhone app, everything counts <em>so much</em> — every design choice, every line of code, everything left in and everything left out.

I was 16 years old when I got my first job. I was a busboy in a seafood restaurant with a view of the Chesapeake and Delaware canal. Big cargo ships went quietly by, gliding along the short cut through the peninsula, watched by people eating crabs, oysters, and shrimp scampi.
</p>
<p>
Whenever things got slow — which wasn’t that often, actually — Neelai the manager would tell us busboys to polish the silverware. "Polish polish polish!"
</p>
<p>
She always said the same thing, with humor but also in a tone that said: <em>this is non-negotiable</em>.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I hear her voice as I work on iPhone code. You can’t hear her voice in text, which is too bad — you’d know why I’ve never gotten "Polish polish polish!" out of my head.
</p>
<p>
In fact, it’s in the plain <em>middle</em> of my head, right in the center, where the oldest stuff that sticks stays.
</p>
<p>
Not a bad start for a poet —&#160;or an iPhone developer.

Thanks to Google, I’ve found that she’s a <a href="http://neelaimoshaver.lnfre.com/About-Me.aspx">real estate agent</a> now.
