<a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/460378/">Buzz’s annual WWDC party</a> is tonight. I’m proud to say that this is the third year in a row that <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/">NewsGator</a> is a sponsor.

<a href="http://golden-braeburn.com/">Golden%Braeburn</a>, Wil’s new company, is also a sponsor — and I recommend checking it out. I’ve heard a bit about it, and it sounds like it could be a very cool thing for indie folks selling their software.
