I hate when my opponents use my full name — Peter Brent Simmons — as if, by pointing out the name <em>Peter</em>, they prove that I’m some kind of bomb-throwing crusadi bent on turning America into a repressive theocracy.

Give my parents a break. They were young and they had never named a baby before. It was years ago, and times were different, and anyway the name doesn’t reflect <em>me</em>. Plus it’s a weirdly common name in some cultures.

So: lay off, willya?
