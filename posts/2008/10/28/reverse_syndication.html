I wasn’t going to write about this at first. But it got stuck in my head, and I realized I think it’s pretty cool.

The widgets folks are putting together 32 NFL widgets, working with 32 online papers, one for each football team. The idea is that one paper includes content from another paper in another town when their teams are about to play.

From the <a href="http://blogs.newsgator.com/newsgator_widget_blog/2008/10/novel-nfl-widge.html">widgets weblog</a>:
</p><blockquote>The best way to explain is through a real-life example: this week the Pittsburgh Steelers are set to play the New York Giants. Leading up to the game, the New York Daily News’s website has a widget on their sports/football page with content on the opposing team — in this case the Pittsburgh Steelers — from The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.</blockquote>
