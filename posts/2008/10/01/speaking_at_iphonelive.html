I’ll be speaking at O’Reilly’s <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/iphonelive2008/public/content/home">iPhoneLive conference</a> on the topic of creating an iPhone app based on a desktop app.
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure that the NDA would have affected my talk much, since it’s fairly high level. But it’s very cool that other talks can go into more technical details as needed. I’m totally looking forward to the conference.
