A few months ago I wrote a little bit about <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=3489">libxml2 and xmlTextReader</a> — I talked about it as an alternate XML parser for use on Macs, but my real point was that it works on iPhones. It’s what I use for NetNewsWire for iPhone.

<p>
The code ran much faster and used less memory than the code I used in the desktop version of NetNewsWire — so I’ll be using this in future versions of NetNewsWire for Mac. A nice example of iPhone development benefits flowing back into Mac development.
</p>
<p>
At any rate, my point is just to provide this as a tip for anyone wondering about how to do XML parsing on iPhones.
