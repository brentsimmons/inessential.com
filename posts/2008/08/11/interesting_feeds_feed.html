When I decided to <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=3515">remove the Sites Drawer</a> from future versions of NetNewsWire, I replaced it with something else: a feed that lists interesting feeds that I find.
</p>
<p>
It’s called, simply, the Interesting Feeds feed. You can <a href="http://ranchero.com/xml/interesting-feeds.xml">subscribe</a>.

I thought about doing other things — loading OPML files written by other people into the Sites Drawer, for instance. But every idea like this meant a bunch of work for little benefit — and a big part of the reason to delete features is to be able to spend more time working on the features that matter most.
</p>
<p>
(Aside: people who don’t write software generally underestimate how much work a given feature takes. People who write just a little software — scripters, for instance&#160;— underestimate even worse.)

So, finally, I decided to go with writing a feed. It has the advantage of being low-tech — I don’t have to build anything new. I use <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> to add items to the feed (since it’s just a category on ranchero.com). And there aren’t any deadlines or pressure. I just post whenever I want to.
</p>
<p>
I’m considering making it a default for new users (for NetNewsWire/Macintosh), though I haven’t decided yet.

Suggestions for the feed are, of course, welcome. I won’t use everything I get. Probably not even half or even a quarter. And it’s not a self-promotion thing: don’t tell me about your feed, tell me about some <em>other</em> interesting feed.
</p>
<p>
(If you tell me about <em>your</em> feed, I’ll tell my cat on you, and he’ll make long red ribbons of your skin, then eat parts of you that are supposed to stay inside you. Just a warning. ;)
