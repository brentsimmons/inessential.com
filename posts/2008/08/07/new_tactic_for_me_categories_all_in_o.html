@title New tactic (for me): categories all in one file

Despite the previous post, I still do use categories. ;) They’re not banned-in-BrentLand.

For the iPhone version of NetNewsWire, I put them all in one file: NNWExtras.m. (“Extras” instead of Categories because there are also a few C functions and one macro defined in that file.)

What I like about this is the discipline it brings. I don’t want that one file to become big, so I’m more reluctant to add a category or category method.
