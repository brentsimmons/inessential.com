I dreamed I met Steve Jobs. I shook his hand — but he had had his right hand replaced by a small foot with small curly toes.</p>

<p>Though surprised, I shook it, and said, “Wow, how innovative!”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Brent,” he said, and smiled, graciously.</p>

<p>(Then something something, I forget, airplanes or alligators or something.)
