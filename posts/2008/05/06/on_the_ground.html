“I was on the ground in Indianapolis...”</p>

<p>I love it when TV People — newscasters, analysts, politicians — say they were “on the ground” somewhere.</p>

<p>It’s a good and welcome reminder that they normally live in the clouds, in heaven, up with the angels. Not on the ground with us, where things are mysterious and messy.</p>

<p>Gosh they’re lucky. Good and lucky.
