Theocacao: <a href="http://theocacao.com/document.page/567">Visible Borders in Designs</a>: “Since each web site doesn’t come with a different physical frame like a book does, designers use borders to convince the reader that they don’t need to be constantly scanning for content areas.”</p>

<p>Scott’s site is, by the way, gorgeous and highly readable, and he makes excellent points.
