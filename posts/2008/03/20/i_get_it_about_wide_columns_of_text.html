I got a fair amount of email about yesterday’s post about <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=3484">page-in-a-page design</a>.</p>

<p>The email all reminded me that wide columns of text are hard to read. Which I totally get, and I mentioned it in the post.</p>

<p>My issue isn’t with column width — in fact, <em>please</em> make columns narrow enough to read — it’s with the actual visible rectangle thing holding in the page-in-a-page.</p>

<p>Here are some sites that don’t do the page-in-a-page thing — they have lines, margins, etc., but not the Big Page Box:</p>
