I figured it would be worth noting how I managed full and Lite versions of the same app, for the benefit of any Cocoa programmers considering the same thing.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s pretty simple, actually.</p>

<p>1. I had a separate target (named NetNewsWire Lite) inside the same project. (The easiest way to get started is probably to duplicate your existing target.)</p>

<p>2. In the Xcode toolbar I made sure the Active Target popup was visible. (So I could switch between targets easily.)</p>

<p>3. In the Groups & Files list, I enabled the Target Membership column, so I could set which files were included in which targets. (Ctrl-click, or right-click, on the Groups & Files header.)</p>

<p>4. Each target had a separate Prefix Header setting. (proprefix.h and liteprefix.h)</p>

<p>5. Instead of just defining #LITE in the prefix header, I did separate #defines per feature. (Not for every feature, but for features that may not appear in the Lite version.)</p>

<p>For instance, proprefix.h has lines like this:</p>

<p><code>#define FIND 1<br />
#define COLUMN_DATE 1<br />
#define COLUMN_SUBJECT 1</code><br />
<em>etc.</em></p>

<p>While liteprefix.h has lines like this:</p>

<p><code>#define FIND 0<br />
#define COLUMN_DATE 1<br />
#define COLUMN_SUBJECT 0</code><br />
<em>etc.</em></p>

<p>Then, in the right places in the code, I used those.</p>

<p><pre>#if FIND
    [do findy things here]
#endif</pre></p>

<p>The reason to do this on a per-feature basis is because it makes it easy to change your mind. For instance, one day I decided that the Lite version should get a date column, and I just edited liteprefix.h and rebuilt.</p>

<p>Easy? Yep.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> I bet I got the per-feature-#defines from working on <a href="http://frontierkernel.org/">Frontier</a>.
