I just uploaded NetNewsWire 1.0.9 to the App Store. I don’t know when it will appear — last time it took about five days, so my guess is Monday the 8th, but it could easily be sooner or later.

NetNewsWire 1.0.9 fixes a bug sending clippings to the server. It also adds separate settings for keeping read and unread news items.
