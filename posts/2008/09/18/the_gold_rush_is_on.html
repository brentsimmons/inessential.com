<a href="http://www.rhonabwy.com/wp/2008/09/18/falling-off-my-chair/">Joe Heck</a> reacts to the news that Trism has made $250,000 since the App Store opened: “I about fell of my chair when I read that. I know a lot of folks have nice sales with the iPhone applications, but that just completely blows through any sort of expectations I ever had.”
