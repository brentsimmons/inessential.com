When I read that Apple’s solution to the problem of the negative press around apps being rejected from the App Store was to <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2008/09/23/apple-extends-non-disclosure-to-app-store-rejection-letters/">add an NDA warning</a>, I thought it was satire. It <em>couldn’t</em> be true.
</p>
<p>
But it appears to be true. If so, then someone is making a mistake. This behavior is definitely beneath the company that makes the software and hardware I adore and love developing for.
</p>
<p>
Apple folks: if there’s any way I can help you find a way out of this, please don’t hesitate to ask.
