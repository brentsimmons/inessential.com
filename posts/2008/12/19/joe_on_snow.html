Joe Heck on <a href="http://www.rhonabwy.com/wp/2008/12/19/snow-days-in-seattle/">Snow days in Seattle</a>: “Our 50 plows are out doing the main roads, but we just never have quite enough to deal with snow that actually sticks around (normally the temp goes back above freezing and we lose almost all the ice and snow within 24-48 hours). Not sure that’ll happen this time — with more expected snow coming in tomorrow.”
