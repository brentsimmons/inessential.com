I saw the iTunes and Last.fm <a href="http://mashable.com/2008/12/03/best-music-of-2008/">top 2008 lists</a> on Mashable and took a couple minutes to listen to excerpts.

And I can only conclude that most people are terribly depressed most of the time. The first world is in danger of a mass extinction event. Suicide by songs.

As an antidote to this maudlin syrup, allow me to recommend an oldie: <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?i=18759035&id=18759057&s=143441">Dreaming</a> by Blondie. You may think you remember the song â€”&#160;but listen again, paying special attention to the <em>drums</em>.

<p>
Just a reminder: human achievement is possible; the air around you need not be so bleak.
</p>
<p>
In other words, listen: <em>buck up, weirdos</em>.
