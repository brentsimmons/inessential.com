Sometimes when I’m working with nested arrays and dictionaries — as a result of parsing some XML, for instance — I don’t even try to keep a map of the structure in my head.
</p>
<p>
Instead I write the dictionary or array out to a file...
</p>
<p>
<code>[someObject writeToFile:@"/Users/brent/Desktop/foo.plist" atomically:YES];</code>
</p>
<p>
...and open it with Property List Editor, so I can actually see the structure. (This also lets me know that the structure I created is the structure I intended.)

<p>
Bonus tip: <code>valueForKeyPath</code> can be super-handy for getting data out of nested structures.
