@title Blog Fuckup

I’ve been working on my blog software (a static site generator) and I managed to screw things up enough that random old posts got published on the site and in the RSS feed.

As soon as I saw the issue I fixed it, but I’ve been getting email from folks about some of the posts, so I know they got picked up by some RSS readers.

Those posts are ancient! Sorry for the confusion.
