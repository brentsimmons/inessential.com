# The App Store Is a Wonderful Achievement

The App Store is unquestionably amazing, one of Apple’s many super-successful innovations.

But, for some reason, Apple executives continue to gild the lily, to talk about the App Store as being even greater than it already is.

Here’s a recent example. While watching [The Talk Show Live From WWDC 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfnvsepVJC0), I noted this discussion of the App Store. The topic was how Apple cares about developers.

Greg Joswiak:
> The iPhone changed the world. We know that. But it did it in combination with the App Store. It did it in combination with apps. People forget what software distribution was like before the App Store. You’re old enough to know. To get software out in the market was tough. You had to find a publisher, right? Publisher took a cut. Channel took a cut. You had to make the goods. In the end of the day the developer was left with very little.

> We wanted to create a safe and trustworthy place where developers could reach all customers. With much more beneficial economics — and level the playing field between big and small.

> Going back to my point of sometimes people are telling distorted stories — it was an economic miracle.
