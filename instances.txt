posts/2014/03/11/imagining_a_scripting_language.markdown:4:My [earlier post](http://inessential.com/2014/03/11/strange_dialect) about WebScript and JSTalk got me thinking: what if I could write part of my app using a scripting language?
posts/2014/03/17/the_bunnies_experiment.markdown:4:After writing about how I was [breaking up Vesper’s timeline view controller class](http://inessential.com/2014/03/16/smaller_please) into smaller objects, I got a bunch of advice suggesting that I go all the way: break out the table view delegates and data source too.
posts/2014/03/21/immutable_objects_and_calculated_propert.markdown:4:I didn’t think about calculated properties in my recent post on [immutable objects](http://inessential.com/2014/03/20/immutable_model_objects).
posts/2014/03/31/sponsorships.markdown:10:In case you’re interested, here’s more [information about sponsoring inessential.com](http://inessential.com/sponsors).
posts/2014/03/08/api_design_the_main_thread_and_queues.markdown:8:He was reacting to my [previous post](http://inessential.com/2014/03/07/async_startup_and_locking) mentioning the requirement that an API is main-thread-only.
posts/2014/03/06/imagining_a_node_blogging_system_for_gee.markdown:6:I’ve written two more just for my own use. The first, PHP/MySQL-based, powered this site for seven years. [The second](http://inessential.com/2009/01/30/new_publishing_system_tour_of_my_head), which I still use, is a Ruby static blog generator. I’ve been using it for five years.
posts/2014/03/06/imagining_a_node_blogging_system_for_gee.markdown:8:I’m a big fan of static sites. In 2011 I wrote [A plea for baked weblogs](http://inessential.com/2011/03/16/a_plea_for_baked_weblogs).
posts/2014/03/15/subclassing_follow-up_the_solution.markdown:4:In [a previous post](http://inessential.com/2014/03/14/a_case_for_subclassing_) I outlined some options I had for a timeline view controller that has three different configurations.
posts/2014/03/13/singletons_follow-up.markdown:4:I figured we were all on the same page about Singletons, but some people have asked me why I used the pattern I used in [my previous post](http://inessential.com/2014/03/13/one_way_to_avoid_singletons).
posts/2014/03/14/rss_feeds.markdown:4:For a long time (at least a year) I didn’t have a visible RSS link on my blog, on the theory that people’s RSS reader would find the feed. But I learned that some people just assumed the blog doesn’t have a feed. It does: you can [subscribe here](http://inessential.com/xml/rss.xml).
posts/2014/03/14/a_case_for_subclassing_.markdown:4:[The other day](http://inessential.com/2014/03/08/gocurious) I mentioned that I’m not a fan of subclassing my own classes. But I may have a case where it’s the least-bad option.
posts/2014/03/25/vesper_sync_diary_11_scaling.markdown:32:When a client asks for notes with recent changes, it sends an <a href="http://inessential.com/2013/11/12/vesper_sync_diary_5_sync_tokens_and_e">opaque sync token</a>  that the server decodes to a date. That date ends up in a SQL query on the serverModificationDate field.
posts/2014/03/25/vesper_sync_diary_11_scaling.markdown:44:(Last time I wrote about this I was <a href="http://inessential.com/2014/02/16/vesper_sync_diary_8_part_three_unique">considering using CityHash</a>. But just using SecRandomCopyBytes and checking for collisions is simpler. Since, on the server, the primary key is note ID + user ID, I don’t have to worry about collisions across users.)

posts/2014/04/18/scaling_and_performance.markdown:4:In the recent [Accidental Tech Podcast](http://atp.fm/episodes/61) John Siracusa pointed out that I had talked about [scaling](http://inessential.com/2014/03/25/vesper_sync_diary_11_scaling) when I was really talking about performance.

posts/2014/04/08/cosmopolitanism.markdown:4:Small thing. When you create a new service in Azure Mobile Services, it gives you some scaffolding — directory structure and a few files.

posts/2014/04/15/premature_optimization_and_servers.markdown:12:Even though Brian Reischl wrote up [how to do data migration](http://inessential.com/2014/04/07/brian_on_data_migration), and so I have a good plan if I ever need to go there, I just don’t ever want to go there.
posts/2014/04/14/vesper_sync_diary_13_part_2_maybe_it.markdown:4:I slept on the thing about <a href="http://inessential.com/2014/04/13/vesper_sync_diary_13_unlucky_13">using 53-bit integers as note IDs</a>. I woke up and it felt weird — slightly but detectably. I listen to those feelings.
posts/2014/04/14/vesper_sync_diary_13_part_2_maybe_it.markdown:58:But if my server-side JavaScript code needs to reference it, then once it passes <a href="http://inessential.com/2014/04/13/vesper_sync_diary_13_unlucky_13">9007199254740992 notes</a> then we’re screwed.

posts/2014/04/14/vesper_sync_diary_13_part_3_thinking_.markdown:6:One is that I’m [thinking too much](http://inessential.com/2014/04/14/vesper_sync_diary_13_part_2_maybe_it) about this. It’ll be fine if I have a properly normalized schema and I use the appropriate indexes. After that, don’t worry.
posts/2014/05/27/vesper_2_0_with_syncing.markdown:6:If you follow my blog, you have a good idea of [the work that went into it](http://inessential.com/vespersyncdiary). Writing about syncing was one of the most fun parts of this — and I very much appreciate all the feedback. It made for a better product. Thank you.
posts/2014/05/28/how_it_went_on_vesper_syncing_day_one.markdown:4:Of course I was anxious about [Vesper syncing day one](http://inessential.com/2014/05/27/vesper_2_0_with_syncing). My job was to write a bunch of iOS and Node.js code that ought to actually work. My job is also to monitor the servers and make sure they’re happy.

posts/2014/11/18/native_and_web_apps.markdown:14:Each of these is a web app in the http sense. NetNewsWire and MarsEdit even had HTML views, and Glassboard had an HTML-based version.

posts/2014/08/04/on_vesper_and_working_efficiently.markdown:6:But, of course, that’s only true when we actually <em>use</em> those features. If we spend our time making <a href="http://inessential.com/2014/07/10/standard_controls">from-scratch custom controls instead of standard controls</a> — for instance — then our apps are more expensive to create than they need to be, and it’s harder to make a profit.

posts/2014/01/07/uitextview_the_solution.markdown:4:Before [posting](http://inessential.com/2014/01/07/uitextview_scroll-to-typing_bug) I’d been all over Apple’s developer forums and Stack Overflow, and I’d emailed with people who had appeared to solve my UITextView problem in their apps.
posts/2014/01/07/uitextview_scroll-to-typing_bug.markdown:6:But with Text Kit came a new UITextView. The old one was based on WebView, and this one isn’t. That makes it a 1.0 version of UITextView, since it’s a new thing. And it has some [bugs](http://inessential.com/2013/10/04/bugs). (Not surprisingly for a 1.0.)
posts/2014/01/30/karl.markdown:4:In a [recent post](http://inessential.com/2014/01/29/dave_and_node) I suggested that a good business might be for someone experienced with both Cocoa and server development to do contract work for other Cocoa developers — to write their servers.

posts/2014/06/08/notes_on_cloudkit.markdown:4:I [just watched](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/) the introduction and advanced sessions on CloudKit. I’ve recently written my own [backend syncing system](http://inessential.com/vespersyncdiary) using [Azure Mobile Services](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/mobile-services/), and that’s the perspective I’ll bring to these notes.
posts/2014/06/08/notes_on_cloudkit.markdown:14:The APIs are a transport mechanism. It uses change tokens for delta updates (what I called [sync tokens](http://inessential.com/2013/11/12/vesper_sync_diary_5_sync_tokens_and_e)). There’s no magic, and error handling is necessary.

posts/2014/12/04/overflow.markdown:10:Now, of course, in any similar circumstance, I use 64-bit integers. (Or at least <a href="http://inessential.com/2014/04/13/vesper_sync_diary_13_unlucky_13">53-bit integers</a>.) Lesson learned.
posts/2014/12/29/before_the_gold_rush.markdown:4:I ran across an old post of mine from 2008, before the App Store opened: [The Coming Gold Rush](http://inessential.com/2008/03/18/the_coming_gold_rush).
posts/2014/12/17/interface_builder_again.markdown:4:This post of mine, almost two years old — [How Much, or How Little, I Use Interface Builder These Days](http://inessential.com/2013/03/06/how_much_or_how_little_i_use_interface) — was referenced on Twitter recently.
posts/2014/12/17/interface_builder_again.markdown:16:And we now have [IB_DESIGNABLE and IBInspectable](http://inessential.com/2014/11/08/first_go_at_using_ib_designable_and_ibin), which makes Interface Builder more useful for designers, which is great if you’re like me and want your designers to have as much direct manipulation as possible.
posts/2015/03/03/misinformation.markdown:10:The response <a href="http://inessential.com/2010/02/26/on_switching_away_from_core_data">to that post</a> continues to amaze me. I come right out and say, multiple times, that you should use Core Data. And yet it’s used as a thing about how Core Data sucks.
posts/2015/03/04/misinformation_part_two.markdown:4:I updated [Beware of Flags](http://inessential.com/2015/03/03/beware_of_flags) with some additional information. (Scroll to the bottom.)
posts/2015/03/18/netnewswire_status_everything_i_know.markdown:14:I *did*, at one point (last Summer, I think), contact them about buying it back, and Black Pixel declined right away (we didn’t get as far as discussing terms). (It would have been a great story, right? NetNewsWire and I go from <a href="http://ranchero.com/">Ranchero Software</a> to NewsGator; NetNewsWire gets placed safely in Black Pixel’s hands as <a href="http://inessential.com/2014/05/10/what_happened_at_newsgator">NewsGator turns into an enterprise company</a>; NetNewsWire returns to Ranchero Software.)
posts/2015/05/27/how_not_to_crash_6_properties_and_acce.markdown:80:Parents should retain their children, but children should have a weak reference to their parents (if they have a reference at all). Weak gets you out of those [invalidate methods where you break retain cycles](http://inessential.com/2015/05/14/how_not_to_crash_1_kvo_and_manual_bind).
posts/2015/05/29/how_not_to_crash_7_dealing_with_nothin.markdown:79:This is part of why, as I [mentioned previously](http://inessential.com/2015/05/22/how_not_to_crash_4_threading), I like to turn JSON into intermediate objects. A big part of this is centralizing the handling of NSNull objects — I don’t want them to leak out into other parts of the app, where anything they touch turns stinky.
posts/2015/05/26/how_not_to_crash_5_threading_part_2.markdown:4:My <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/05/22/how_not_to_crash_4_threading">previous post about threading</a> left open the question of how code running outside the main thread communicates — safely — back to the main thread.
posts/2015/05/22/how_not_to_crash_4_threading.markdown:18:This solves a bunch of problems. For instance, I wrote in an earlier post about [unregistering for notifications in dealloc](http://inessential.com/2015/05/21/how_not_to_crash_3_nsnotification). A few people pointed out that you can’t guarantee on which thread dealloc will be called — but you *can*, actually, for any given object that runs on the main thread and is referenced only on the main thread.
posts/2015/02/10/vaccines_again.markdown:4:Whenever the subject of <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/02/10/cold">vaccines</a> come up, I remember my post from a few years ago about <a href="http://inessential.com/2009/10/29/vaccines">chicken pox</a>. I wish the chicken pox vaccine had been available then. My eyes wouldn’t be so ruined.
posts/2015/11/16/blogs_by_women.markdown:86:<a href="http://inessential.com/2015/11/19/blogs_by_women_opml_file">There is now an OPML file</a> which you can import into your RSS reader.
posts/2015/11/19/blogs_by_women_opml_file.markdown:4:In <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/11/16/blogs_by_women">Blogs by Women</a> I presented a list of blogs of interest to Mac and iOS developers, designers, and power users that are written by women.
posts/2015/07/04/the_liscio_approach_to_variants_in_swift.markdown:6:(See [Swift question: Enum vs. Struct for Variants](http://inessential.com/2015/06/23/swift_question_enum_vs_struct_for_vari) and, before that one, [Swift Protocols Question](http://inessential.com/2015/06/21/swift_protocols_question).)
posts/2015/07/29/swift_diary_5_yet_more_uses_for_kvc.markdown:4:I’ve argued before (<a href="http://inessential.com/2015/07/22/swift_diary_2_kvc">here</a> and <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/07/24/swift_diary_4_kvc_again">here</a>) that pure Swift objects and structs need KVC or something like it.
posts/2015/07/29/swift_diary_5_yet_more_uses_for_kvc.markdown:58:This is also just a few lines of code away from a syncing system [like the one in Vesper](http://inessential.com/vespersyncdiary). In Vesper the various properties have a modification date property. (For instance: note.text and note.textModificationDate.)
posts/2015/07/19/secret_projects_diary_3_decision_to_ma.markdown:6:Now I’m faced with a decision. Even though there are solutions to <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/07/19/secret_projects_diary_2_swift_2_0_prot">my earlier post regarding Swift and protocols</a>, there are lots and lots of places that need solutions.
posts/2015/07/24/swift_diary_4_kvc_again.markdown:4:Al Skipp <a href="https://twitter.com/al_skipp/status/624549746640834560">wisely writes</a> (in reply to <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/07/22/swift_diary_2_kvc">my post about KVC</a>):
posts/2015/09/30/swift_bikeshed_week_three_question.markdown:4:It was my week to <a href="http://inessential.com/langvalue">come up with a question</a>.
posts/2015/08/05/swift_diary_9_where_im_stuck.markdown:6:I’ve got the problem that <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/07/19/secret_projects_diary_2_swift_2_0_prot">I’ve written about before</a> — protocols and collections don’t mix well.
posts/2015/08/13/swift_diary_page.markdown:4:I collected my recent <a href="http://inessential.com/swiftdiary">articles on working with Swift</a> on a single page. It’s linked-to at the bottom of every page on the site, so you can find it later.
posts/2015/06/10/how_not_to_crash_9_mindset.markdown:10:And that’s why I have rules like <em><a href="http://inessential.com/2015/05/22/how_not_to_crash_4_threading">do everything on the main thread except for perfectly isolatable things</a></em> and <em><a href="http://inessential.com/2015/05/27/how_not_to_crash_6_properties_and_acce">avoid unsafe_unretained always</a></em> and so on.
posts/2015/06/10/how_not_to_crash_series_finished.markdown:4:All done. (At least I think so — I might think of more things, I suppose.) There’s a <a href="http://inessential.com/hownottocrash">new page that links to all the posts</a>. There’s a link to it at the bottom of every page on this site.
posts/2015/06/23/swift_question_enum_vs_struct_for_vari.markdown:4:In a <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/06/21/swift_protocols_question">previous post</a> I mentioned using structs plus a protocol to implement a variant type. There’s a Value protocol and a number of different structs that conform to that protocol.
posts/2015/06/14/secret_projects_diary_1_post-wwdc_note.markdown:12:The new Swift goes a long way toward curing <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/02/04/random_swift_things">angle-bracket blindness</a>. But, more importantly, now we know what Swift will be once it grows up (and it’s growing up fast) — and that thing, a protocol-centered language, is a thing I want.
posts/2015/12/10/im_harping_on_this.markdown:18:Until you realize that, in Swift, you <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/07/19/secret_projects_diary_2_swift_2_0_prot">can’t</a> do <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/08/05/swift_diary_9_where_im_stuck">this</a>.

posts/2012/05/22/applescript_and_fastscripts_to_the_rescu.markdown:4:I wrote about a <a href="http://inessential.com/2012/05/22/hiding_the_last_app">thing that bugged me</a> — and Daniel Jalkut <a href="https://gist.github.com/2773193">wrote an AppleScript</a> that solved the problem for me.
posts/2012/02/28/bad_eyes.markdown:8:One of the odder effects of such bad near-sightedness (which I got <a href="http://inessential.com/2009/10/29/vaccines">thanks to chicken pox</a>) is that I can see things extremely well at that short distance. Which means I can see the pixels on my iPad.

posts/2012/08/23/an_iphone_app_startup_performance_techni.markdown:48:This meant adopting the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Protocols/NSCoding_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html">NSCoding</a> protocol for several of my classes (statuses, boards, and people). (Since I’m not using Core Data — for good reasons worth writing up, and different from <a href="http://inessential.com/2010/02/26/on_switching_away_from_core_data">last time</a> — this was easy.)
posts/2012/06/18/how_glassboard_got_its_name.markdown:4:I’ve written before the real story about <a href="http://inessential.com/2011/10/30/how_marsedit_got_its_name">how MarsEdit got its name</a>. (Hint: the story involves beer.)
posts/2012/06/29/matthew_on_twitter_restrictions.markdown:26:So you standardize on a feed format. RSS would work great, of course, and there’s a ton of RSS reading and writing code out there already — and it’s <a href="http://inessential.com/2011/06/15/what_we_talk_about_when_we_talk_about_rs">not like it’s dead</a>. (For instance, just this week Apple released a major <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/06/bye-bye-downloads-apples-new-podcasts-app-enables-streaming/">iPhone app that uses RSS</a>.)
posts/2012/06/30/more_details.markdown:4:I left out a bunch of stuff when writing about <a href="http://inessential.com/2012/06/29/matthew_on_twitter_restrictions">replacing Twitter</a> yesterday.

posts/2000/02/08/2_8_2000.html:13:<p>I got some email about my statement that I wished Mac OS X were Linux-based. The gist of it was that it didn&#039;t matter, since Mac OS X should be able to run PPC Linux binaries. But here&#039;s one thing (out of many things) I wonder about: will I be able to install the same software that runs on my LinuxPPC machine? What I do is go to the <a href="ftp://ftp.linuxppc.com/linuxppc-1999/RedHat/RPMS/">LinuxPPC FTP server</a>, download an RPM, type rpm -Uvh whatever-it-is, and it&#039;s installed. It doesn&#039;t seem likely that I could do this with Mac OS X. Maybe I&#039;m wrong? <a href="http://inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$143">Discussion continues</a>...</p>

The long national nightmare is over. What&#039;s interesting to me is that my choice of desktop isn&#039;t dictated by my preferred OS, or the quality of apps in general, it&#039;s the quality of the web browser. And even with the speed boost my Mac browsers got on <a href="http://inessential.com/2000/01/16">Sunday</a>, IE 5 for Windows was still superior. What that says about the state of web browsers isn&#039;t good. What that says about the relative importance of web browsers is, however, good.</p>

(Here is perhaps the [first tweet](https://twitter.com/harpaa01/status/1110654293760053248) I saw along these lines.)

And then, of course, discussions, mostly internal to Black Pixel, happened for a few months, because that’s how these things go — and we managed to make it official on August 31, 2018. (See [NetNewsWire Comes Home](http://inessential.com/2018/08/31/netnewswire_comes_home).) Black Pixel gave it to me for free (we never haggled over price; that was their plan all along), and their generosity remains one of the things I’m most thankful for in my entire career.

posts/2018/01/15/evergreen_diary_4_send_to_micro_blog.markdown:24:By the time I was working on NetNewsWire 2.0, it became apparent that smooshing a blog editor into a reader app meant that the blog editor suffers. The blog editor in NetNewsWire 1.x was pretty darn bad. So I had the idea of splitting out the blog editor to a separate app — inducing mitosis — which you can read about in my [MarsEdit report](http://inessential.com/2004/12/12/marsedit_report) of late 2004.

I think it’s a solvable problem as long as you recognize the limits. But I don’t have time to work on it (and I no longer write a client app that would use it). Nevertheless, I still think the best bet is an open source system that is simple and easy-to-install.

posts/2011/11/23/pub_rules.markdown:36:I believe that people way underestimate the value of fast-loading pages. You never want someone to hesitate before following a link to your site because they remember that it’s slow. You don’t want people to give up before getting the chance to read the article.

posts/2005/06/02/experimenter_gatherer.html:11:<p>Anyway, here’s a <a href="http://inessential.com/images/chiclets.png">screenshot</a> which shows my first cut at it. You can look at it and say, “Oh, I’m glad <i>that</i> didn’t ship”—but remember, this was just experimental, not intended to ship as-is, just a rough draft of an idea.</p>
posts/2005/06/02/experimenter_gatherer.html:13:<p>So then I re-did it so the chiclets were right next to the subscription name—and that wasn’t good, as you can see <a href="http://inessential.com/images/chiclets2.png">here</a>.</p>
posts/2005/06/02/experimenter_gatherer.html:15:<p>And then I thought—let’s move the numbers flush-right again, but use alternating row colors in the subscriptions, and only display a chiclet outline for the selected sub. And <a href="http://inessential.com/images/subsWithAltRows.png">that</a> didn’t really work out, either. And then <a href="http://inessential.com/images/subsWithLines.png">another version</a> had a line going from the sub name to the unread count. Arf!</p>
posts/2005/06/02/experimenter_gatherer.html:17:<p>Finally—last version—<a href="http://inessential.com/images/subsWithDots.png">dots</a>!</p>

posts/2003/03/17/greatest_hits.html:9:<p>My personal favorite is on how <a href="http://inessential.com/2001/06/07.html">it&#8217;s so hard to teach squirrels to play baseball</a>.</p>
posts/2003/03/17/greatest_hits.html:11:<p>Here&#8217;s my <a href="http://inessential.com/2002/03/04.php">BBEdit song</a>.</p>
posts/2003/03/17/greatest_hits.html:13:<p>Here&#8217;s one on the inherent evil of <a href="http://inessential.com/2002/01/17.php">that Three Dog Night song</a> Joy to the World.</p>
posts/2003/03/17/greatest_hits.html:15:<p>Then there&#8217;s my list of <a href="http://inessential.com/2001/12/28.php">top ten really mean put-downs</a>.</p>
posts/2003/03/17/greatest_hits.html:17:<p>Though it&#8217;s not terrifically funny, I like it as a rant: how I <a href="http://inessential.com/2001/05/18.php">don&#8217;t want wearable computers</a>.</p>
posts/2003/03/17/greatest_hits.html:19:<p>Here&#8217;s a post on how I like to <a href="http://inessential.com/2001/02/15.php">say inappropriate things</a>. I compare a part of my anatomy to a roll of duct tape.</p>
posts/2003/03/17/greatest_hits.html:21:<p>Another personal favorite is <a href="http://inessential.com/2000/08/31.php">Frank, a fable</a>.

posts/2003/10/03/whats_cool_about_mutt_and_pine.html:5:In the <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=2653">comments</a> for my previous post about email on two computers, Jerry wrote: “Anything to avoid mutt and pine; they should be permanently retired along with POP accounts.”</p>
posts/2003/10/30/shareware.html:9:<p><img src="http://inessential.com/images/papaSm3.jpg" align="right" height="71" width="60" hspace="5" />I’m not sure what it means these days. My company may be small (<a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/">my wife</a>, me, and a fierce gray tabby), and we don’t have a physical box for our product, but I don’t think of our business as being fundamentally different from larger software companies. I’ve never called NetNewsWire a shareware app (though other people have, and it doesn’t bother me.)</p><h4>Three types of companies</h4><p>

posts/2004/05/20/more_about_netnewswire_2_0.html:31:<p>The changes in NetNewsWire warrant the 2.0 designation. (I listed <a href="http://inessential.com/2004/04/20.php">some of the changes</a> back in April. There are some other changes not on the list, still under wraps for now.)</p>

posts/2004/10/05/marsedit_and_wysiwyg_editing.html:37:<p><i>Update 8:20 PM Pacific:</i> I certainly don’t mean to imply that Adriaan or any other developer who has added WYSIWYG editing is wrong to do so before a full-featured WYSIWYG editing component is available. A black hole for one developer with one product is not necessarily a black hole for another. Not at all. (See the <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=2937">comments</a> for more on this.)

Excellent question. The answer is simply that when I’m in the last phase of a project I like to be as conservative as I can. The mindset I have when I’m fixing bugs and adding polish is not compatible with making big infrastructure changes. (You ever watch the TV show <a href="http://www.usanetwork.com/series/monk/">Monk</a>? This is the Monk phase of the project.)</p>

But then that would make the button quite a bit larger, out-of-step with other buttons... and there I set it aside for a while.</p>
