@title Sponsorship

Your sponsorship:

* Appears as a blog post on a Monday of your choice and is exclusive for the week.
* Goes to the site’s 20,000 RSS feed subscribers.
* Appears as a text-with-link ad on the sidebar on every page for the week. (Average: 40,000 page views per week.)

#### Price

A sponsorship for one week costs $750. For two or more weeks, each week is $650.

#### Audience

Inessential readers are developers — iOS and Mac developers especially — and power users.

They are people you’d hire. People who go to conferences. People who read. People who learn. People who buy software and services. People who like high-quality things.

#### How It Works

You write the title and HTML. On publication we’ll put [Sponsor] at the beginning of the title.

Use whatever links you want. We’re happy to help edit your post if you like.

Keep it under 150 words. Shorter is better — people are more likely to click.

Once you’re happy with your post, send it to us and we’ll publish it on your chosen Monday morning.

Easy.
