@title Brent’s Retirement Party
@pubDate 2025-06-09 16:51:42 -0700

I’ve retired as of June 6! Last job ever! And there’s a party! And you’re invited! 🐣🐥🎩🎉

#### Where

[Bale Breaker and Yonder Cider Taproom](https://www.bbycballard.com/)<br>826 NW 49th St, Seattle, WA 98107

We’ve reserved an area outside, with a half-dozen picnic tables. There will be signs that say “Brent’s Retirement Party!” on or near the tables.

#### When

Thursday, June 19, 2025<br>5 pm - 10 pm

It’s open-house-style — show up whenever works for you.

#### Drinks and food

Free beer! Free cider! See Brent and Sheila for drink tickets.

We’ll have some crackers, cheese, salami, and imported Kit-Kats, like you do.

For more of a meal you’re on your own — but note that the [Impeckable Chicken food truck](https://www.impeckablechicken.com/) is scheduled to be there. [Fair Isle Brewing](https://fairislebrewing.com/), just a block away, has a kitchen, and there are other food trucks and places in the area.

#### Bring the family

Please bring your spouse or partner, even if we’ve never met.

Also: Bale Breaker is all ages — you can bring your kids. Dogs too!

#### Gratuitous picture

Here’s me *before* I started working for a living… 😀
