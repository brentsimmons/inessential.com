@title Apps I’ve Made

My wife Sheila and I are <a href="http://ranchero.com/">Ranchero Software</a>, where we’re working on two new open source projects — Mac apps — that aren’t shipping yet:

- **[Evergreen](https://github.com/brentsimmons/Evergreen)**
- **[Rainier](https://github.com/brentsimmons/Rainier)**

Evergreen, a feed reader, is closer to shipping than Rainier.

By day I work at <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/">The Omni Group</a> where I do a podcast called [The Omni Show](https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/) and write for [The Omni Blog](https://omnigroup.com/blog/) (among other things).

#### The Past

Most recently I wrote **<a href="http://vesperapp.co/">Vesper</a>** with <a href="http://betterelevation.com/">Dave Wiskus</a> and <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">John Gruber</a> at Q Branch. Vesper has been made open source and [released on GitHub](https://github.com/brentsimmons/Vesper).

These apps I created now live elsewhere:

<b><a href="http://netnewswireapp.com/">NetNewsWire</a></b> (2002) is now at <a href="http://blackpixel.com/">Black Pixel</a>.

<b><a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a></b> (2004) is now at <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/">Red Sweater</a>.

These apps I helped create now live elsewhere:

<b><a href="http://www.taplynx.com/">TapLynx</a></b> (2009) is now at <a href="http://push.io/">Push IO</a>, which is now at Oracle.

<b><a href="http://glassboard.com/">Glassboard</a></b> (2011) was at <a href="http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/">Second Gear</a>, but has since been turned off.

#### Distant Past

I worked on **<a href="http://frontierkernel.org/">UserLand Frontier</a>** 1996-2002. 

Before that — 1995-1996 — I released software that worked with WebSTAR: **<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19991021212201/http://www.ranchero.com/spotlight/">SpotLight</a>**, DenyAgent, and something else (I can’t remember its name). SpotLight sold about 10 copies; DenyAgent and that something else sold zero copies. But they *shipped*. :)
