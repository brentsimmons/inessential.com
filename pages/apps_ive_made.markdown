@title Apps I’ve Made

I’m working on two open source projects — Mac apps — that aren’t shipping yet:

- **[NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/)**
- **[Rainier](https://github.com/brentsimmons/Rainier)**

NetNewsWire 5.0, a feed reader, is much closer to shipping than Rainier. I started NetNewsWire in 2002, and worked on it until 2011 when Black Pixel acquired it. It [came back to me](http://inessential.com/2018/08/31/netnewswire_comes_home) in August 2018.

#### The Past

<b><a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a></b> (2004, Ranchero Software) is now at <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/">Red Sweater</a>.

<b>TapLynx</b> (2009, NewsGator) was acquired by <a href="http://push.io/">Push IO</a>, which is now at Oracle. It has been discontinued.

<b>Glassboard</b> (2011, Sepia Labs), a group messaging app, was acquired by Second Gear, but has since been turned off.

**Vesper** (2013, Q Branch), a note-taking app, was written with <a href="https://twitter.com/dwiskus">Dave Wiskus</a> and <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">John Gruber</a>. Vesper has been made open source and [released on GitHub](https://github.com/brentsimmons/Vesper).

#### Distant Past

I worked on **<a href="http://frontierkernel.org/">UserLand Frontier</a>** 1996-2002. 

Before that — 1995-1996 — I released software that worked with WebSTAR: **<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19991021212201/http://www.ranchero.com/spotlight/">SpotLight</a>**, DenyAgent, and something else (I can’t remember its name). SpotLight sold about 10 copies; DenyAgent and that something else sold zero copies. But they *shipped*. :)
